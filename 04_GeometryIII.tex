\textbf{Strategies Practice:} The SATs will test the same concept(s) in many different ways. Identify what area(s) the questions use. If you need help, then you can refer to the â€œAbout the math section at the beginning of this guide. Then, solve the questions.

Geometric probability uses probability concepts (the chance of an event occurring) to analyze shapes (which you use to find the chance of all possible events occurring).

\item I and III only
\item II only
\item I, II, and III only
\item I, II, III, and IV
