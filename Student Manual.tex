\chapter{Introduction}

ASC's SAT Advanced course is designed to help students master the most difficult topics on the SATs. By focusing on and practicing these topics, advanced SAT students can improve their SAT scores.

\bigskip
The SAT is composed of ten sections—a 25-minute essay, six 25-minute sections, two 20-minute sections, and one 10-minute section. Total testing time is 3 hours and 45 minutes. The breakdown of each section is as follows:

\vfill
\newpage
\begin{spacing}{1.25}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|*4{@{ }>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}X|}}\hline
\centerline{\textbf{Topic}} & \centerline{\textbf{Testing Time}} & {\textbf{Number of Questions}} & \centerline{\textbf{Skills Tested}}\\\hline
Critical Reading & Two 25 minute sections and one 20 minute section & 67 Questions in total: 19 sentence completions and 48 passage based questions & Vocabulary, sentence logic, answering questions and making inferences about a text\\\hline
Math & Two 25 minute sections and one 20 minute section & 54 Questions in total: 44 multiple choice and 10 student-produced responses & Integrating and applying mathematical concepts, including algebra, functions, geometry, probability, statistics, and data interpretation\\\hline
Writing Multiple Choice & One 25 minute section and one 10 minute section & 49 Questions in total: 25 Improving sentences, 18 identifying sentence errors, and 6 improving paragraph questions & Sentence structure and grammar, coherence and cohesion\\\hline
Writing Essay & 25 minutes & Write one essay on a given topic & Writing and analysis skills\\\hline
\end{tabularx}
\end{spacing}

\bigskip
You should also be aware that SAT test includes one 25-minute section called the “experimental section”. It can be in critical reading, math, or writing and is used by the testmakers to design and test questions for future exams. This section does not contribute to your SAT score, however, you won't know which section is the “experimental section”, so you should try your best on every part of the exam.

\bigskip
\underline{SAT Scoring}

Each section (critical reading, math, and writing) is scored by giving you a raw score and then converting that to a scaled score. The raw score is the number of questions that you got correct minus one-fourth of the questions that you got wrong. Leaving a question blank does not affect your score. This equation can be seen as:

\bigskip
\textbf{Raw Score: \underline{\hspace{1in}} correct $\boldsymbol{-}$ 0.25 (\underline{\hspace{1in}}) incorrect = \underline{\hspace{1in}}}

\bigskip
The raw score is then converted to a scaled score between 200 and 800 points. It should be noted that in the writing section, essay score is also factored into your scaled score. Additionally, in the math section, correct student-produced responses (grid ins) are worth one raw score point whereas incorrect student-produced responses (grid ins) do not affect your score.

\bigskip
This brings us to two very important questions:

\bigskip
\begin{inparaenum}[\bfseries1. ]
\item \textbf{If wrong answers lead to subtracting points, but a blank does not affect my score, should I guess?}

\bigskip
The answer is, it depends. If you are able to eliminate at least one choice, then the long run average results in the same or greater raw score than if you didn't guess. This also depends on the individual test taker's personality. Someone that tends to be more cautious might be tempted to leave a lot more blank than one should. On the other hand, a person that is more risk-inclined may have a tendency of not leaving enough blank. Therefore, if you are unsure, then you should complete a practice section leaving a few blank and guessing on the majority of questions that you don't know for sure and find your raw score using the equation above. Then, calculate what your raw score would have been had you left more of the ones that you were unsure of blank. Use whatever strategy gives you the highest score.


\bigskip
\item \textbf{What is a ``good'' SAT score?}
\end{inparaenum}

\bigskip
Although many people know that the coveted 2400 is a perfect score on the SATs, many students and parents wonder what other scores are classified as ``good''. This question does not have a simple answer because a ``good'' SAT score for one college might not be ``good'' for a more competitive school. For example, the top schools in the country tend to look for scores at least in the 700s in each of the three sections (2100 total), whereas smaller, less competitive schools will accept lower scores. While it is true that the higher a student's SAT scores are, the more opportunities will be available to a student, there are schools for students with a large range of SAT scores. Fortunately, there are tools to help students figure out their SAT score goal and what is a ``good'' score for their ability level and the colleges that they are hoping to gain acceptance from.

\bigskip
So what is a “good” score on the SAT? The answer is: it depends on what schools and, in some cases, what programs of study a student is aiming for. Therefore, first step in deciding what a “good score” is would be to decide what colleges or universities interest you and come up with a few ideas of what you might want to study. Next, just check online what scores your ideal school is looking for and make it your goal to score a bit higher just so you stand out among all the other applicants. Oftentimes, the university's website will contain the average SAT score and GPA for admitted applicants. They might also give a 25\% to 75\% percentile scores. Someone in this range might be a good match for the school, whereas it might be more difficult for someone with SAT scores than the 25\% percentile to be admitted. The College Board (the same company that makes the SATs) also has an online program called ``My College Matches'' to help students identify colleges that might be good for them sorted by individual factors such as SAT score. Identifying potential areas of study could also help to put SAT scores in context. For example, a student who scores a 2100 by getting 800s on the verbal and reading section and a 500 on math might make it into a writing program at a top university but would not be considered by a high ranking technical institution. Every school and every student's situations are different.

\newpage
\textbf{\large About the Critical Reading Section}

The critical reading section is composed of two parts, sentence completions and passage-based reading. The sentence completion focuses on vocabulary and sentence logic in order to select the word that best fits in the blank within the sentence. It is imperative that students learn to detect the types of sentence completions and the clues given in each of the sentences which will lead to the correct answer. For the passage-based reading, students will learn the types of passages and questions tested as well as strategies for detecting the correct answer and the reasons that incorrect answers are incorrect.

\bigskip
\textbf{\large About the Math Section}

The following topics are tested on the SAT math section: number and operations, algebra and functions, geometry and measurement, and data analysis, statistics, and probability questions. 

\bigskip
Below is a list from the College Board of each topic tested in more detail:

\bigskip
\begin{outline}
\0 \underline{Number and Operations ($20-25$\% of the test)}
\1 Arithmetic word problems (including percent, ratio, and proportion)
\1 Properties of integers (even, odd, prime numbers, divisibility, and so forth)
\1 Rational numbers
\1 Sets (union, intersection, elements)
\1 Counting techniques
\1 Sequences and series (including exponential growth)
\1 Elementary number theory
\0 \underline{Algebra and functions questions ($35-40$\% of the test)}
\1 Substitution and simplifying algebraic expressions
\1 Properties of exponents
\1 Algebraic word problems
\1 Solutions of linear equations and inequalities
\1 Systems of equations and inequalities
\1 Quadratic equations
\1 Rational and radical equations
\1 Equations of lines
\1 Absolute value
\1 Direct and inverse variation
\1 Concepts of algebraic functions
\1 Newly defined symbols based on commonly used operations
\0 \underline{Geometry and measurement questions ($25-30$\% of the test)}
\1 Area and perimeter of a polygon
\1 Area and circumference of a circle
\1 Volume of a box, cube, and cylinder
\1 Pythagorean theorem and special properties of isosceles, equilateral, and right triangles
\1 Properties of parallel and perpendicular lines
\1 Coordinate geometry
\1 Geometric visualization
\1 Slope
\1 Similarity
\1 Transformations
\0 \underline{Data analysis, statistics, and probability questions ($10-15$\% of the test)}
\1 Data interpretation (tables and graphs)
\1 Descriptive statistics (mean, median, and mode)
\1 Probability
\end{outline}

You will note that there is no pre-calculus or advanced trigonometry (sine, cosine, tangent, etc.), so if you haven't taken these classes, don't worry about it. However, you should be cognizant of when you took what classes and, consequently how much time that you will need to focus on each topic. For example, an 11th grader that took geometry in 9th grade may need to spend more time reviewing geometry than a 11th grader that is currently in a geometry class.

\bigskip
\textbf{\large About the writing section}

The writing section is composed of two sections, the 25 minute essay and multiple choice questions. Students will learn what the SAT graders are looking for and also practice with timing, brainstorming, and writing so that they can get a perfect score on the essay. Students will also be exposed to the three types of writing multiple choice questions-- sentence improvements, sentence errors, and paragraph improvements—as well as the grammatical or other writing concepts taught in this section.

\section[General Strategies]{General Strategies for the SAT Geometry Section}

\bigskip
\textbf{Strategy \#1: Visualization is key!} As we saw in the strategy section of the warm-up, \longline can help to break up complex language and also to give you a jumping off point to start solving the problem. If the SAT problems give you a diagram as part of the problem, then you should always start by marking the information given or that you can directly deduce directly onto the image.

\bigskip
\textbf{Strategy \#2: Minimize the number of variables!} Not having numbers at the onset of a problem can increase the difficulty level of the SAT problem, particularly the geometry problems. Therefore, if you can covert these relationships or variables to \underline{\hspace{1.5in}}, then it is easier to think about and solve the problem.

\bigskip
One way to do this: Whenever there is a relationship between two objects (angles, line segments, etc.), you are probably going to need to numerically solve for this relationship. This will either be your answer or it will directly be used to find your answer. Therefore, if you see a ratio in the problem, then convert it to variables and solve for the variables if possible. If you can convert a line segment to a number line with numerical distances, then do it!

\vfill
\newpage
\section{Distances on a Line}

\bigskip
Examples:

\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{enumerate}[label*=\arabic*.]
\item \textbf{Medium}

In the $xy$-coordinate plane, point $A$ is at $(1,5)$ and point $B$ is at $(-a,-3)$. The distance between points $A$ and $B$ is 12. What is the value of $a$?
\vfill
\phantom{}
\columnbreak
\item \textbf{Medium}

Lines $l, m,$ and $r$ are all different lines that lie in the same plane. If $l\perp m, m\perp r$, and $r\perp s$, which of the following must be true?

\bigskip
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Roman*.]
\item $l\perp s$
\item $l\parallel r$
\item $m\perp s$
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
\item I only
\item I and II only
\item I and III only
\item II and III only
\item I, II, and III
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{multicols}

\vfill
Problem solving strategy for distances on a line:

\begin{spacing}{1.5}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Roman*)]
\item \longline if one doesn't exist
\item \longline the diagram (what is equal to what, etc). Convert it to a

\longline if possible
\item Solve for the \longline of the different segments
\item Use the information in steps \#$1-3$ to \longline

Other questions will ask you about the slope of a line or about parallel or perpendicular lines.

\bigskip
\textbf{To find the slope of a line:} You need at least 2 points on the line. Write down the $x$ and $y$ coordinates for points 1 and 2. Then, slope = $(y_2-y_1)/(x_2-x_1)$.

\bigskip
\textbf{About parallel lines:} Parallel lines have the same slope. To find the equation of a line parallel to the given line, find the slope of the given line (see \#1). It is also the ``$m$'' term in the equation of a line, $y=mx+b$. Then, plug in $x$ and $y$ coordinates to the equation of a line with the same $m$ as the original line and solve for $b$.

\bigskip
\textbf{About perpendicular lines:} The slopes of perpendicular lines are negative reciprocals. To find the equation of a line perpendicular to a given line, Find the slope of the given line (see \#1). It is also the ``$m$'' term in the equation of a line, $y=mx+b$. Then, take it's negative reciprocal to find the slope for the perpendicular line. Plug in $x$ and $y$ coordinates to the equation of a line with the m that was solved for in the previous step. Solve for $b$.

\section[SAT Algebra]{General Strategies for SAT Algebra}

It can be difficult to know every concept on the SATs or more frequently, which topic(s) is best used to solve the problem. Therefore, if you get to a problem that you don't know how to solve, then you can use the following strategies to help you find the right answer. They spell the acronym PUFS (like the tissue company but with only 1 letter ``F'').

\textbf{SAT Math Strategy 1: Plug in real number}

\bigskip
Many SAT problems are made unnecessarily tricky by using \longline instead of \longline.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Assigning each variable a unique, \longline (for example, if there are variables $a, b$, and $c$ in the problem, make $a=2, b=3, c=5$). These numbers should be easy to work with. If you are using percentages, it is recommended to use \longline for the base variable because percentages are out of 100.
\item Solve the problem with these \longline instead of variables.
\item If necessary, translate the numbers back to \longline, percentages, fractions, etc
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Try It:} If $a$ is 1/3 of $b$ and $b$ is 2/5 of $z$ and $z>0$, then $a$ is what percentage of $z$?

\textbf{SAT Math Strategy 2: Use the answer choices}

If the question is multiple choice, then you may be able to plug in the answer choices into the question to see which answer choice gives you the correct answer.

\bigskip
Hint: It is suggested in SAT literature that if you try this approach, that you should start with answer choice C and work outwards or answer choice E and go backwards from E to A because the SATs will rarely make problems that can be solved with this strategy to have answer choice A.

\section[Functions]{Algebra Topic \#1: Functions}

Connection to previous material learned:

\begin{itemize}
\item If $y=x^2-1$ and $x=-2$ what is the value of $y$? \longline
\item If $y=1-x$ and $y=-2$, what is the value of $x$? \longline
\item A problem-solving strategy to keep in mind: If you have a problem with lots of variables and don't know how to solve it, you should try to \longline the answer choices to help you solve the problem. For example, we could \longline for each variable, plug in this number into the problem and each of the answer choices, and solve to see which solution of the answer choices \longline the solution in the question.
\end{itemize}

\vfill
Functions have the form $f(x)=$ some definition with an $x$, such as $f(x)=x^2-1$. The notation for a function is a letter and $x$ combination, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$. Both can be treated as $y$, so ``If $y=x^2-1$ and $x=-2$, what is the value of $y$?” becomes ``If $f(x)=x^2-1$ and $x=-2$, what is the value of $f(x)$?'' and ``if $g(x)=1-x$ and $g(x)=-2$, what is the value of $x$?'' \longline

\vfill
The variable in the parentheses is what gets plugged in to the definition. For example, $f(2)=x^2-1$ can be written as $f(2)=$\longline. Now solve $f(2)=x^2-1$ to get an answer of \longline. You may also get questions that give you the value of the output, f(2), and ask you to find the variable, $x$. Therefore, if the value of $f(x)=3$ and the definition of $f(x)=x^2-1$, what is $x$? \longline.

\vfill
Sometimes you may be given the input and output ($x$ and $f(x)$) and then be expected to find the equation or part of an equation, such as a coefficient or a constant in the equation. To do so, plug in the numbers given in the problem and solve for the unknown.

\vfill
What should you do when you have two functions in the same problem? The output of one function can solve as the input for another function. For example, if $f(x)=x+1$ and $g(x)=2x$, then what is $g(f(x))$? To find this, start with the \longline. In this example, we can find the value of $f(x)$. Then plug this output into the x value of the function on the outside. Using $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ defined earlier in this paragraph, what is $f(g(2))$? What is $g(f(2))$? \longline

\vfill
The SATs will also define novel functions with a weird symbol $-$ such as $\diamond$, $\uparrow$, \$, etc. $-$ and ask you to then solve for some part of the function. These are often called ``weird symbol problems''. Most of the time, you need to solve the equation that they give you using the number in the problem. For example, if $\#g\#=g+1$, then what is \#5\#? \longline If $\#g\#h\#=gh-h$, then what is \#5\#6\#? \longline.

\section{Functions with Charts and Graphs}

Sometimes, there are questions with charts containing the input, x, and the corresponding output, f(x). These questions will usually ask you to find the equation that fits the line of the \longline.

\bigskip
In order to solve these types of problems, you will need to plug x and f(x) into the equation given or in the answer choices. Most of the time, you will need to check that the equation with \longline points rather than just one because more than one answer choice will work for one pair of $x$ and $f(x)$ values.

\bigskip
Example \#1: given the chart of the quadratic function below, what is the general equation of the function?

\bigskip
\begin{spacing}{1.5}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|*6{@{}>{\centering\arraybackslash$}X<{$\arraybackslash}|}}\hline
x & -2 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 2\\\hline
f(x) & 5 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 5\\\hline
\end{tabularx}
\end{spacing}

\section{Functions and Graphs}

Functions may be graphed on an $xy$-coordinate plan. Remember that in the form of the function $f(x)$, the value of $x$ in the $f(x)$ is plotted on the $x$-coordinate and the value of $f(x)$ is treated as the $y$-coordinate.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Graph the quadratic function given in example \#1 above:

\plane

\item What is the minimum of the function?
\item Use the graph to find $f(2)$.
\item Use the graph to find $x$ when $f(x)=2$
\end{enumerate}

The SATs will often ask about transformations of the graph of a function. Determine how each of the following transformations will affect a function. Then, draw the transformation of the function $f(x)=x^2+1$ on the grid beside the transformation.

\section[Word Problems]{Functions and Equations in Word Problems}

Given the equation and asked to solve for the input or output or you may be given a problem and be asked to choose the function that best represents the problem.

\bigskip
There are 2 general types of questions of this type on the SATs:

\begin{enumerate}
\item A situation may be modeled by a function and will ask you to solve for the value of the function (so you would solve for f(x)) or could ask you what value of x will produce a certain value of y (so you would solve for x)

\vfill
\item They may give a situation and ask you to choose the equation that best models it. The equation may have numbers and variables. The strategy for solving these is to solve or check your answer by plugging in real numbers for each of the variables and solving.
\end{enumerate}

\vfill
Example \#1: To rent a lane for a party at a bowling alley is \$30 per hour plus \$10 per person attending the party. Which of the following functions models the total cost, in $d$ dollars, to rent the room for a 2 hour party for $n$ people?

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
\item $f(n)=40n$
\item $f(n)=30+10n$
\item $f(n)=60+10n$
\item $f(n)=30n+10$
\item $f(n)=70n$
\end{enumerate}

This question is fairly straightforward. However, what if there was a twist so that there were more variables?

\bigskip
Example \#2: To rent a lane for a party at a bowling alley is \$f per hour plus \$x per person attending the party. Which of the following functions models the total cost, in $d$ dollars, to rent the room for an $m$ hour party for $n$ people?

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
\item $f(n)=fmn$
\item $f(n)=f + xn$
\item $f(n)=mf + xn$
\item $f(n)=(f+x)n$
\item $f(n)=mfx+n$
\end{enumerate}

Example \#2 looks much more difficult than Example \#1, however it is really the same problem but with variables instead of numbers. We can use a strategy to help us solve or check our answer for example \#2.

\vfill
\textbf{SAT Math Strategy:} When you have a problem and answer choices with variables and you don't know how to solve it, assign one number to each variable and solve the problem in the question and the answer choices. Each of the numbers should be relatively small so that they are easy to work with and different from the numbers you assign other variables. Your answer is the answer the choice that matches the value in the question. 

\bigskip
For example \#2, we can assign $f=5, x=2$, and $m=1$. So we have a 1 hour party for 2 people with a room cost of \$5 per hour. Therefore, the total cost should be \$7. Now we need to calculate the result of each of the answer choices using $f=5, x=2$, and $m=1$ to see which answer choice(s) give us \$7. If there is more than one answer choice that gives you the numerical answer that you are looking for, then you should pick different numbers for each variable and re-solve for the answer choices that originally matched what you are looking for.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
\item $f(n)=fmn=5*2*1=10$

We can eliminate this as the possible correct answer.

Now, solve this for each of the other possible answer choices.

\item $f(n)=f+xn$
\item $f(n)=mf+xn$
\item $f(n)=(f+x)n$
\item $f(n)=mfx+n$
\end{enumerate}

\section{Patters and Sequences}

A remainder is the amount left over after \longline. For example, six will divide into 19 three times with a remainder of \longline.
We can usually use one of two strategies to solve these types of problems.

\vfill
\textbf{Strategy \#1:} If a remainder problem contains a variable problem, then we can

\longline that fits the parameters and then use this number to solve for what the problem is asking. 

\bigskip
For example: When 2m is a divided by 4, the remainder is 5. What will the remainder be when $3m$ is divided by 10?

\vfill
\textbf{Strategy \#2:} Then you need to come up with \longline and solve for the \longline in order to solve. 
For example, When 48 is divided by a positive integer $n$, the remainder is 4. How many values of $n$ are possible?

\vfill
We are also going to use a strategy similar to Strategy \#2 in order to solve problems that repeat numbers, symbols, etc. by using divisibility rules. We are particularly interested in the  \longline.

\bigskip
For example, A fashionista is laying out her colored scarves. She first lays down 2 red scarves, then 3 blue scarves, then 1 green scarf, then 2 orange scarves, then 1 pink scarf. She repeats this pattern until she has laid out all 1,000 scarves. What color is the 782\textsuperscript{nd} scarf?

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
\item red
\item blue
\item green
\item orange
\item pink
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Start by writing \longline iterations of the pattern on top of each other:
\vfill\item \longline the end of each line
\vfill\item You will see that you are counting up by \longline occurring in the first line
\vfill\item Divide the \longline by the \longline.

Find the \longline.
\vfill\item Start at the beginning of the pattern. Count each unique item in the pattern until you reach the same number as the \longline. This item in the pattern is the \longline.
\end{enumerate}

Example \#2: There are 5 ducks in a row behind the mother ducks, Ariel, Boston, Carl, Devin, and Edward. Every day, the ducks take a turn swimming behind the mother so it is Ariel's turn, then Boston's turn, then Carl's turn, then Devin's turn, then Edward's turn. If Boston swims behind his mother on the first day, who will be swimming behind the mother on the 42\textsuperscript{nd} day?

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
\item Ariel
\item Boston
\item Carl
\item Devin
\item Edward
\end{enumerate}

\vfill
Example \#3: Every day, Steven runs one errand or completes one chore. On the first day, he goes to the grocery store. On the next day, he goes to the laundry mat, and on the next day, he goes to the pharmacy. On the next day, Steven goes to the car mechanic, and on the next day, he cleans the house. After this, he repeats his chore list (so the day after cleaning the house, he goes to the grocery store). One day that he went to the car mechanic, he went to the movies immediately afterwards. Which of the following could be the number of days he did chores prior to the day that he decided to go to the movies? \textbf{[Note: In previous problems, it has given you the total number and wants you to find the unique item. This problem gives you the unique item, that he goes to the movies, and wants you to use divisibility rules to find the total number. You can use steps \#1-5 above, but you need to reverse them.]}

\vfill
We will use the idea of writing out the possible items to solve problems that ask about the minimum number of items selected in order to guarantee some situation. 

\bigskip
For example, there are 144 marbles in a box. There are 24 marbles of each of the following colors: red, blue, green, white, black, and gray. Tom randomly selects marbles from the box.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
\item What is the minimum number of marbles Tom needs to select in order to guarantee that he gets at least two marbles of the same color? 

\bigskip
To solve this, we need to think of the \longline. In this scenario, he selects \longline before he selects a second marble of any color.

\newpage
\section{Probability}

In general, probability of an event is occurring is defined as:

\vfill
The most difficult type of probability questions are when multiple events are occurring because you must take into account the wording of the question to give you a clue as to whether the events are happening together or separately and also if the items are getting replaced or not (as this will affect the denominator when you are solving the problem). 
Probability is a number between \shortline and \shortline. \shortline represents the sum of all of the events that could happen. For example, on a fair two-sided coin, the options from one coin flip are getting a tails or a head (and nothing else). The probability of getting the tail side is ½ and the probability of getting the head side is $1/2$ and$1/2 + 1/2 =1$.

\vfill
If you want to know the probability of an event not happening, you will need to find the probability of it happening and subtract this probability from \shortline. This is called the \longline.

\vfill
\longline events are when the results of the first event affects the probability of the second event occurring or not occurring.

\vfill
\longline events are when the results of the first event affects the probability of the second event occurring or not occurring.

\vfill
If you want to know the probability of two independent events happening, then

\longline the probabilities. For example, you would use this method when you select a ball from a jar, put it back in the jar, and then choose another ball (called choosing with replacement).

\vfill
If you want to know the probability of two dependent events happening, then you will need to \longline the probability of the second event based on the first event happening. For example, you would use this method when you select a ball from a jar, and then choose another ball without putting the first ball back (called choosing without replacement).  If the probability of choosing a green ball is 7/10 and you want to know the probability of choosing two green balls in a row without replacement, then you calculate the probability of the first ball being green, 7/10, and the second ball being green with the first green ball removed, which is $(7 - 1)/(10 - 1) = 6/9$. Therefore, the probability of getting two green balls in a row without replacement of the first ball would be $7/10 \cdot 6/9 = 42/90$.

\vfill
If you want to know the probability of neither happening, you will need to find the probability of either happening and subtract this probability from \shortline. This is called the \longline.

\vfill
\newpage
We will now use one example and see how many ways a problem can be asked. In each case, there are 10 red balls and 12 blue balls in Jar $A$ and 3 red balls and 9 blue balls in Jar $B$. Show your work when solving for each problem so that you can see the differences between the words and problem-solving steps for it.

\item A person picks one ball from Jar A, records the color, puts it back in the jar and then picks a ball from Jar B. What is the probability that the first ball is red or the second ball is blue?

The SATS will include summaries of data in the form of tables, charts, and graphs.

\begin{itemize}
\item Basic questions will ask to you to find information from the visual given. Oftentimes, you will need to perform a basic operation on the numbers that you are pulling from the data, such as adding products from one year to another year or converting the percentages on a circle graph (pie chart) to actual numbers.
\vfill\item More difficult questions can be difficult for the following reasons: 1) The question asks you to perform a more complicated operation based on information given the visual or 2) The question or the visual data includes a component that is extremely tricky. See some of the tricks used (and how to avoid them) in the strategy section below.

\textbf{Strategies for surviving the visual data and data analysis section}

\item Strategy \#1: Read the written information. This may include the main title, the $x$-axis title, and the $y$-axis title. \textit{Pay particular attention to the scaling information found immediately after the titles. It is possible (and probable on the more difficult problems) that the $x$- and $y$-axes will have different scaling.}

\vfill
\item Strategy \#2: When a question is asked about percent increase or decrease, remember that the change is relative. This means that in a bar graph, a relatively small bar becoming only slightly smaller might still be a larger percentage increase than a huge bar turning into a smaller bar. Why does this phenomenon occur? (Hint: think about the general equation for percentage increase or decrease.) \hrulefill

\vfill
\item Strategy \#3: Identify what you are solving for in the question before you solve the problem, and after you have solved for an answer, check to make sure that your answer actually represents what you were asked to solve for in the question.

The more complicated SAT problems on averages usually have to do with solving for\ldots

\textbf{A part of the sum (the numerator of the equation)}- you can do this by using a variable like $x$ to represent the unknown part of the sum and then get $x$ by itself.

\vfill
\textbf{Finding weighted averages}- The average of 50 and 60 is 55 (the middle). However, when you take the average of 50, 60, and 60, the average is closer to \shortline than 60. As a result, you can take into account the number of occurrences weighted by the value of each unique occurrence. This answer will be your sum that can be plugged into the averages formula. 

\vfill
\textbf{The average from visual data}- Here you will find the number of occurrences weighted by the value of each unique occurrence from the chart. Then, solve using the strategy presented in the``finding weighted averages'' category above.

\chapter[Multiple Choice Part I]{SAT Writing Multiple Choice Part I}

\section{SAT Worksheet 1A: Warm-Up}
\textit{Today, we will begin studying and unlocking the secrets of doing well on the SAT writing multiple choice sections. To help you and your instructor better assess your background in this area, please answer the following questions.}

\bigskip
Reflect on your most recent written assignments (ranging from one paragraph to multiple pages). What grammatical concepts do you think that you know and execute well?




\vfill

What grammar concepts do you have the most trouble with, that is to say, what types of errors do you make the most frequently? 

\vfill
\pagebreak
\section[Types of Questions]{Types of Questions on the Writing Multiple Choice Section}

The multiple choice section on the writing Section Multiple Choice has three types of questions: error identification, improving sentences, and improving paragraphs.

\bigskip
\textbf{In sentence error questions,} you will read a sentence and circle the part of the sentence that contains the error. There will also be an option for no error. 

\bigskip
For example:

\begin{inparaenum}[A]
\begin{spacing}{1.25}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{*8{@{}>{\ }c}}
Every day & Maria and & me & go & to the store & \ & to buy milk, & bread, and cheese.  \\\cline{1-1}\cline{3-3}\cline{5-5}\cline{7-7}
\item &  &\item & & \item & &\item &  \\
\end{tabularx}

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{*1{@{}>{\ }c}}
No error
\\\cline{1-1}
\item\\
\end{tabularx}

\end{spacing}

\end{inparaenum}

What would you select here as the error?

\bigskip

\bigskip

\bigskip

\bigskip

\bigskip

\textbf{In sentence improvement questions,} you will be asked to select the best version of a sentence.

\bigskip
For example:\\
Every day, Maria and me go to the store to buy milk, cheese, and bread.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)] \itemsep-0.4em
\item{Every day, Maria and me go to the store to buy milk, cheese, and bread.}
\item{Every day, Maria and me are going to the store to buy milk, cheese, and bread.}
\item{Every day, Maria and I are going to the store to buy milk, cheese, and bread.}
\item{Every day, Maria and I go to the store to be buying milk, cheese, and bread.}
\item{Every day, Maria and I go to the store to buy milk, cheese, and bread.}
\end{enumerate}


\bigskip

\bigskip
What is the best version of the original sentence? Remember, the best answer must preserve the meaning of the original sentence, be free of grammatical errors, and be concise.


\bigskip

\bigskip

\bigskip

\bigskip

\bigskip

\textbf{In the paragraph improvement questions,} the SAT will present you with a paragraph and then ask you to improve the questions at a sentence level (similar to the paragraph improvement questions) or the paragraph level. They can ask about editing, moving, deleting, or adding a sentence to the paragraph in order to increase the clarity.

\bigskip
For example: \\
(Sentence 1) Most parents and students stress about getting accepted to the colleges of their choice, but it can be very difficult to figure out what colleges are really looking for. (2) There are other factors that are also worthy of student's and parent's attention. (3) For example, did you know that community service, extra-curricular activities, a strong personal essay, or a display of interest in the particular school can all help you get accepted? (4) Unlike in other countries which rely solely on grades and an admission test, admissions to American universities are holistic. 

\bigskip

\bigskip
Which of the following improvements should be made to the paragraph above?

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]\itemsep-0.4em    %I changed this so that the question and answer choice were so spread out.I do want to keep the page break after this question.
\item{Keep as is}
\item{Move sentence 1 to before sentence 4}
\item{Add “In addition to SAT scores and grades” to the beginning of sentence 2}
\item{Change “are” to “were” in sentence 2}
\item{Delete sentence 3 }
\end{enumerate}

\pagebreak

\section[Grammar Topics]{SAT Worksheet 2A: Grammar Topics Frequently Tested on the SAT Writing Section}
Directions: Read about each of the grammar rules below. Fill in the blanks with the correct response(s) according to the rules described.


\bigskip
\textbf{\large Subject-Verb Agreement}


\subsection{Subject - Non-essential clause - Verb}
These sentences often insert a non-essential clause, set off by commas, between the subject and verb to distract you.

\bigskip
Ex: Apple computers, though popular in the United States, is/are less common in other countries.

\bigskip
‘Though popular in the United States' is a parenthetical clause.  It can be removed from the sentence without affecting its overall meaning.  In this case, it separates the subject “Apple computers” from the verb “are”.\\
In these kind of sentences, just cross out the parenthetical clause and check that the verb agrees with the subject.

\subsection{Subject - Prepositional Phrase - Verb}
A prepositional phrase begins with a preposition, such as with, from, to, of, in, on, and over.  When prepositional phrases sit between subjects and verbs, they can distract from subject-verb agreement.

\bigskip
\textbf{Circle the correct verb:} 
Changes in the temperature of the Earth seem/seems small, but even small changes have a huge environmental impact.


\subsection{Prepositional Phrase - Verb - Subject}
In this case, the subject comes near the end of the sentence rather than the beginning. Make sure to identify if the subject is singular or plural.


\bigskip
\textbf{Circle the correct verb:}
\begin{enumerate}\itemsep-0.4em
\item{Along the Charles River is/are many runners and cyclists.}
\item{Along the Charles River is/are a runner and a cyclist.}
\item{Along the Charles River is/are a runner.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{There is/There are, There has/There have}
There is/has = Singular noun
There are/have = Plural noun

\bigskip
\textbf{Circle the correct verb:} 
There has/have been many questions and few answers about the missing plane.

\subsection{Neither/Nor + Verb}
The verb always agrees with the noun after ``nor.''

\bigskip
\textbf{Answer the following questions about the sentence:}
Neither Mark nor his brother plays/play an instrument.\\
What is the noun after ``nor''? \hrulefill \\
Is this noun singular or plural? \hrulefill

\bigskip
Important:\\
Collective Nouns (e.g. company, school, city, country, committee, jury, agency etc.) are singular.

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Each, Every, One = Singular}
\item{A singular noun, followed by ``in addition to,'' ``as well as," or ``including''} remains singular.
\item{A number (of) = Singular}
\item{(N)either one OR whether (n)either clearly refers to two singular nouns = Singular}
\item{Gerunds when used as subjects (e.g. Taking standardized tests often takes several hours) = Singular.}
\item{What and whether as subjects (e.g.``Whether dogs or cats are better is a subject of debate for some people."); both are singular.}
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip
\textbf{Practice: Circle the correct verb for the sentences below.}
\begin{enumerate} 
\item{The restaurants near the club which host/hosts celebrity parties stay/stays open until 3 am.}
\item{The polka dot pattern of our skirts reflect/reflects the trend this season.}
\item{Each group of four students has/have to make a PowerPoint for their presentation.}
\item{My neighbor with all the cats walk/walks down the street every morning.}
\item{Everybody take/takes a writing class in the first semester.}
\item{The people who watch that show is/are few.}
\item{The boat captain, as well as his crew, is/are highly trained.}
\item{The beginning of the book, including chapters one through five, is/are boring.}
\item{Five dollars is/are a lot of money.  U.S. dollars is/are worth less than euros.}
\item{Neither my sister nor I enjoy/enjoys seafood.}
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip

\bigskip
\section{Pronoun Reference}
\subsection{Pronouns Must Have Clear Antecedents}
Singular nouns go along with singular pronouns, such as he, she, his, her, it, its.
Plural nouns go along with plural pronouns, like them and their.

\bigskip
\textbf{For example:}
A person who wants to play professional sports must spend all of his/her time practicing.

\bigskip
People who want to play professional sports must spend all of their time practicing.

\bigskip
A pronoun must have a clear antecedent, the noun, pronoun, or gerund (e.g. swimming, reading, eating) to which it is referring.

\bigskip
Wrong: Because of the severe drought, they don't have enough to drink.
\textit{They has no clear antecedent.}

\bigskip
Fix it: \hrulefill

\bigskip
Wrong: In the essay, it analyzed the themes of resistance to totalitarian rule.
\textit{It has no clear antecedent.}

\bigskip
Fix it: \hrulefill

\bigskip
Wrong: Katy and Lucy are going to take her car.
\textit{Her has no clear antecedent.}
Fix it: \hrulefill

\subsection{Do So vs. Do it}

Do it = Wrong \\
Do so = Right 

\bigskip
For example: People who travel do it because they love exploring.\\
What does `it' refer to in this sentence? Traveling. But since the gerund `traveling' doesn't actually appear in the sentence, `it' has no real antecedent.

\bigskip
\textit{Important:
For both Subject-Verb Agreement and Pronoun Agreement, be on the lookout for collective nouns such as family, group, committee, jury, city, agency, team, etc. These nouns are always singular, and it is not uncommon for the SAT to pair them with plural verbs and pronouns. Whenever one of these words appears, you should immediately be suspicious.\\
In sentence error questions, ``it'' is often wrong.  If ``it'' is underlined, check its antecedent immediately!}

\bigskip
\textbf{Practice: Circle the pronoun error. Then, give a possible correction.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Whenever Katy and Sara go out to dinner, she pays for the check.}
\item{Even if a student has perfect grades, they have no guarantee of getting into Harvard.}
\item{At the zoo, they saw lions, zebras, and giraffes.}
\item{He always drives on empty, and this really bothers me!}
\item{Although it is a lot bigger, elephants can still be hunted and eaten by lions.}
\end{enumerate}


\section{Run-ons}
A comma cannot connect two independent clauses.  This error is called a ``comma splice.'' Check if the two sentences should be separated by a period, a semi-colon, or a transition word like ``so''.

\bigskip
\textbf{Practice: Correct the following sentences. }
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Thank you for your consideration, I look forward to hearing from you.}
\item{In Europe, the cafes are very relaxed, people can sit for as long as they like.}
\item{Karlee was interested in international relations, she applied to graduate programs all over the world.}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Dangling Modifiers} 
Modifiers are words or phrases which modify other elements in the sentence, usually nouns.  They usually can be removed from the sentence without affecting the structure of the sentence overall.

\bigskip
Incorrect: Grabbing a towel, the showers were my first stop. \\
Correct: Grabbing a towel, I headed for the showers. 

\bigskip
In this sentence, “grabbing a towel” is the modifier.  It modifies “I”.  When it is placed next to “the showers,” it sounds like the showers grabbed a towel.  That is impossible.

\bigskip
Incorrect: Having quit her job to travel, Ecuador was Sophie's first stop.  Ecuador didn't quit its job to travel!  Sophie did.

\bigskip
Fix it: \hrulefill


\bigskip
\textbf{Practice: Correct the following sentences. At least two should be corrected by placing the modifier at the beginning of the sentence ending with a comma and the subject immediate after the comma.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Krystal saw three orange cars jogging down the street.}

\item{The teacher impressed his students playing ultimate Frisbee.}

\item{Decorated with lights, we took pictures in front of the town Christmas tree.} 


\item{After scoring the game-winning goal in the last minute, the crowd cheered for the hockey player.}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Parallel Structure}
Use the same pattern of words at the word, phrase, or clause level. Read about parallel structure and fill in the blanks where provided.

\subsection{At the word level:}
Incorrect: I like swimming, hiking, and to raft.\\
Correct: I like swimming, hiking, and rafting.\\
Correct:  I like to swim, hike, and raft.\\
Also correct:  I like to swim, to hike, and to raft.

\subsection{At the phrase level:}
Incorrect:  The homework should be done quickly, accurately, and in a thorough manner.\\

\bigskip
Incorrect:  The teacher praised him because of his hard work, motivation, and he was conscientious.\\
Correct: The teacher praised him because of his hard work, motivation, and
\longline   %The previous command made a line that was too dark. I think that this command is correct but please check.

\subsection{At the clause level:}
Incorrect: To prepare for this test, you should study, get a good night's sleep, and eating breakfast is important. \\
Correct: To prepare for this test, you should study, get a good night's sleep, and eat breakfast.\\
Also correct:  To prepare for this test, you should study, you should get a good night's sleep, and you should eat breakfast.

\bigskip
Incorrect:  The teacher expected that his students would pay attention, do their homework, and that questions would be asked.\\
Correct:  The teacher expected that his students would pay attention, do their homework, and \hrulefill \\
Also correct:  The teacher expected that his students would pay attention, would do their homework, and \hrulefill.

\subsection{In a list after a colon}
Incorrect:  Remember to pack the following: toothbrush, change of clothes, and you will also need hiking boots.

\bigskip
Correct:  Remember to pack the following: toothbrush, change of clothes, and hiking boots.

\subsection{With common pairs}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Prefer\ldots to\ldots}
\item{(Decide) between\ldots and\ldots}
\item{Not only to\ldots but also to\ldots}
\item{Neither\ldots nor\ldots}
\item{Either\ldots or\ldots}
\item{As\ldots as\ldots}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{With comparisons}

Incorrect: Americans drive bigger cars than European countries.\\
Correct:  Americans drive bigger cars than people in European countries.

\bigskip
Incorrect:  I like jogging more than hikes outside.\\
Correct: I like jogging more than \hrulefill.

\bigskip
\textbf{Practice: Circle the word(s) that do not follow parallel structure. Then, correct the sentence so that it follows parallel structure.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item{I respect your intelligence and that you are eloquent.}
\item{To improve reading comprehension, remember to take notes, to draw inferences, and summarizing.}
\item{Doing well on the SATs requires to study for months.}
\item{My little sister prefers macaroni and cheese over broccoli.}
\item{It's hard to decide between going on vacation or saving money.}
\item{The movie is not so funny as everyone insists it is.}
\item{To write poetry is appreciating the details and beauty in your surroundings.}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Adverbs vs. Adjectives}
Adjectives describe nouns.\\
For example: Tall man, beautiful flower, miraculous recovery.  

\bigskip
Adverbs describe verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs.  Adverbs often end in –ly.\\
Smile happily, run quickly, work confidently, do well, act fast, amazingly fast runner.

\bigskip
\textbf{Practice: In the following sentences, correct the adjective or adverb errors.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Meghan, who did not feel confident about her performance, received an astonishing high score on her English final.}
\item{Rapid advancing technology has completely transformed most industries.}
\item{He watches TV so loud that I can't sleep.}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Verb Tenses}
If you see a date or time period in a sentence, it is probably a question about verb tense.  If there is no error in verb tense, then you can choose E) No error.

\bigskip
\subsection{A. Tense Consistency}
Generally, if a sentence starts in the present, it should stay in the present.  If it starts in the past, it should stay in the past.

\bigskip
Correct:  Since the student received no financial aid, she \longline to attend a community college for two years and then transfer.

\bigskip
Correct:  Since Bella hates snakes, she always \longline the reptile house at the zoo.

\subsection{B. Present Perfect vs. Simple Past}
Present perfect—has gone, has swum, has sung, has drunk

\bigskip
Simple past—went, swam, sang, drank.

\bigskip
Usually a sentence that includes a date or time period should have a verb in the simple past.  

\bigskip
Incorrect:  During the Salem Witch Trials in 1692, nineteen people have been accused of witchcraft and have hung on Gallows Hill.\\
Correct:  During the Salem Witch Trials in 1692, nineteen people \longline of witchcraft and hanged on Gallows Hill.

\bigskip
Incorrect:  During Queen Elizabeth's reign, Shakespeare has become a renowned playwright.
Correct:  During Queen Elizabeth's reign, Shakespeare \longline a renowned playwright.

\subsection{Would vs. Will}
Incorrect:  George Washington, who will become the first president of the United States, was born in 1732.\\
Correct:  George Washington, who \longline the first president of the United States, was born in 1732.

\bigskip
Do not use would or would have if the sentence or clause begins with if.
Incorrect:  If he would have arrived earlier, we would not have missed the movie. \\
Correct:  If he \longline arrived earlier, we would not have missed the movie.

\subsection{Gerunds vs. Infinitives}
Incorrect: Though he was one of the only students gaining admission to the Ivy League, Tom did not let his success go to his head.
Correct:  Though he was one of the only students to gain admission to the Ivy League, Tom did not let his success go to his head.

\bigskip

Correct:  The traffic prevented us \longline in time.

\bigskip
Past perfect: \\
Incorrect:  By the time we started playing, the sun came out.\\
Correct:  By the time we started playing, the sun \longline out.

\subsection{Singular-Plural Noun Consistency}

Correct:  The boss gave her employees \hrulefill

\bigskip
Incorrect:  Earth, water, air, and fire were considered an element by ancient scientists.\\
Correct:  Earth, water, air, and fire were considered  \longline by ancient scientists.

\section{Comparatives vs. Superlatives}
Comparatives, like better, worse, faster, smaller, compare two things or people.\\
Superlatives, like best, worst, fastest, and smallest, describe one thing as the best of many or compare three or more things or people.

\bigskip
Incorrect:  Between Jim and Bob, Jim was the best student and Bob was the worst student. \\
Correct:  Between Jim and Bob, Jim was the better student and Bob was the worse student.

\bigskip
Incorrect:  Texas is the biggest state in the continental U.S., and it has more oil.
Correct:  Texas is the biggest state in the continental U.S., and it has the \longline oil.

\section{Sentence Fragments}
Fragments may contain a noun and a verb but they do not contain one or more independent clauses. Fragments must be corrected to form complete sentences. 

\bigskip
A fragment may not be a sentence because...
\begin{enumerate}
\item{It describes something, but there is no subject-verb relationship}
\item{It may have most of the makings of a sentence but still be missing an important part of a verb string.}
\item{It may locate something in time and place with a prepositional phrase or a series of such phrases, but it's still lacking a proper subject-verb relationship within an independent clause.}
\item{It may even have a subject-verb relationship, but it has been subordinated to another idea by a dependent word and so cannot stand by itself.}
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip
\textbf{Practice: Turn the following sentence fragments into complete sentences.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{In the middle of the day, when most people are at lunch, while I enjoy the quiet of my classroom.} \hrulefill 
\item{Although vanilla is the most popular ice cream flavor, but some people consider it boring.} \hrulefill
\end{enumerate} 

\section{Shift in Point of View}
The subject in each clause should be consistent.  For example, it is incorrect to switch from 2nd person “you” to third person “one.”

\bigskip
Incorrect: Even when I leave at 7 am, traffic gets me stuck.\\
Correct:  Even when I leave at 7 am, I get stuck in traffic.

\bigskip
Incorrect:  You should condition your hair if one doesn't want it to be dry.
Correct:  You should condition your hair if \longline don't want it to be dry.

\bigskip
Incorrect: If one does not study, you will not get a high score.
Correct:  If \longline  do not study, you will not get a high score.  OR  If \longline  does not study, one will not get a high score.

\subsection{You and Me Errors}
I = subject\\
Me = object

\bigskip
In an example with a plural subject, such as ``my friends and me," eliminate ``my friends" and check if the sentence still makes sense.  You cannot say ``Me went to the carnival" or ``Are you going to go white water rafting with I?"

\bigskip
Incorrect:  My friend and me went to the carnival.\\
Correct:  My friend and I went to the carnival.

\bigskip
Incorrect:  Are you going to go white water rafting with my friends and I? \\
Correct:  Are you going to go white water rafting with my friends and me?

\bigskip
Incorrect:  The magician was skilled in creating allusions.\\
Correct:  The magician was skilled in creating illusions.

\bigskip
Incorrect:  The ice storm caused averse road conditions.\\
Correct:  The ice storm caused \longline road conditions.

\section{Hypothetical Statements and the Subjunctive}
The subjunctive is used in sentences that express hypothetical situations, including a wish, emotion, possibility, judgment, opinion, necessity, or action that hasn't happened yet.

\bigskip

\section{That vs. Which}
That- Use that to introduce clauses with no commas, or restrictive clauses.

\bigskip
Dogs \longline don't wag their tails might try to bite you.

\bigskip
Which- Use which to introduce clauses with commas, or non-restrictive clauses.

\bigskip
Growling, \longline is usually a sign of aggression in dogs, is a warning to back off.

\vfill
\section{Among vs. Between}
Use between for two things, places, or people.\\
For example: Brian and Mike split the pizza \longline themselves.

\bigskip

For example:  Brian, Mike, and Luigi split the pizza \longline  themselves.

\vfill
\section{Who versus Whom}
Who is used when the noun or pronoun is doing the action (it is a direct object like he), whereas whom is used when the noun or pronoun when an action is being done to it (it is an indirect action pronoun like him).

\bigskip
For example, ``Who is throwing the spiders at the children?" is correct and``To whom is Marla throwing spiders at?"

\bigskip
In this example, who is the direct object pronoun and whom is the indirect object pronoun.

\bigskip
\textbf{Fill in the following examples:}

\section[Multiple Choice Strategies]{Strategies and Practice for SAT writing Multiple Choice}

We will now focus on strategy and practice for the sentence error identification and sentence improvement questions. 

\bigskip

The most commonly tested and missed grammar points can be seen below. When you are answers sentence error or improvement questions, BE A CYCLOPS and always be keep one eye open for these most commonly missed grammar points.

\bigskip
\textbf{B is for “being”:} The word “being” is commonly heard in speech but does not usually make for the best sentences.

\bigskip
\textbf{E is for agrEEmEnt:} Identify the subject and the verb that is associated with the subject. The verb needs to match the subject in number and gender. This means that the subject and the main verb need to be both singular or both plural. 

\bigskip

\bigskip
\textbf{A is for awful verb tense:} Check when the action is happening and then if the given verb tense can be used to describe the time period that the action is happening. 

\bigskip

\bigskip
\textbf{C is for clause (aka commas towards the beginning of the sentence):} Clauses at the beginning of sentences have a description, then a comma, then more words. The description must be describing the first word after the comma. 

\bigskip
\textbf{Y is for you, me, and other pronouns:} If “you” is not in the underlined section, then it must be paired with “you” in the underlined section. If “one” or “someone” is not in the underlined section, then it must be paired with you in the underlined section. Also, make sure that pronouns like “it” or “they” clearly refer to the subject of the sentence. 

\bigskip
\textbf{C if for contrasts and other conjunction/connectors:} Words like “and” are used to add another idea, however, words like “but” are used to show differences between things. 

\bigskip
\textbf{L is for list:} If there is a list, all of the words must be the same part of speech and the same verb tense. 

\bigskip
\textbf{O is for “of” and commas that might separate the subject and the verb:} The verb ending is dependent on the singularity or plurality of the subject.

\bigskip
\textbf{P is for preposition:} Make sure the preposition matches the word before it. To combat this, learn your idioms!

\bigskip
\textbf{S is for short:} Is the sentence as short as it can be without changing the meaning? 

\newpage
\section[Sentence Error]{Strategy for Sentence Error Multiple Choice Questions}

Your goal on the sentence errors is to determine whether or not there is an error in the sentence. If so, then you must mark the error.

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Read through the sentence. If you clearly hear an error, then mark it. On sentence errors, you are done.}
\vfill\item{If you can't hear an error, check for the errors listed in SAT Writing section Part I and also the errors in BE A CYCLOPS. If you see one of those points that are incorrect, then mark it.} 
\vfill\item{Many students get nervous when they can't find an error. They are unsure of whether there is an error or if the entire sentence is correct. Remember, answer choice, “E”, no error, is the correct answer in approximately 20\% of the questions. To feel better about choosing “E”, we recommend going through each of the blanks and labeling the grammar point covered. For example, if the word “you” is underlined, then the grammar point tested is probably pronouns. Then, remind yourself of this grammar rule and ask yourself if it is properly executed. If so, then move on to the next one. If you finish answer choice “D” and there is still no errors, then “E” is most likely your answer choice.}
\end{enumerate}

\section[Sentence Improvement]{Strategy for Sentence Improvements}
Your goal on the sentence errors is to choose the best sentence out of the 5 answer choices. Some answer choices may be technically correct, but only one choice is “the best”. This will be the one that is the most clear (no grammatical errors) and concise. 

\begin{center}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Read through the sentence. If you clearly hear an error, then circle it (e.g. if the verb tense is wrong, circle the verb).Think about what you would do to change the error. }
\item{Scan through the answer choices to see if how you would change it is a choice. If so, read the full sentence with the underlined portion you just selected in the sentence. If the full sentence makes sense, select it and move on to the next question. }
\item{If you know there is an error but aren't sure what it is, read through the answer choices and eliminate ones that don't make sense. Then, read the full sentence with the underlined portion for each sentence. Mark the best answer choice and move on to the next question.} 
\item{If you don't know whether or not there is an error, check for the errors listed in the SAT Writing Section Part I and also in the BE A CYCLOPS acronym.\\
Select the correction and read the full sentence to make sure it makes sense and contains the original meaning of the sentence.  Then move on to the next question.  }
\item{If you still have no idea, then skip the question. You can come back to it at the end of the section or leave it blank (remember, because you get deducted points for getting a question wrong, it can be advantageous to skip a handful of questions that you do not know for each section. }

\section[Paragraph Improvement]{Paragraph Improvement Questions}
The SATs have 6 questions about Improving Paragraphs. Although Improving Paragraphs questions do not make up a huge portion of the test, they are still important to your ability to do well on the Writing section and your overall score.  

\bigskip
Improving Paragraphs questions are more “big picture”: they won't ask about grammar errors within sentences, but they may ask you to improve a sentence that is too wordy, unclear, out of order, or lacking a transitional word or phrase.

\bigskip
You can think of the skills tested by the Writing Section like a series of building blocks that start small and grow bigger (though the questions don't come in this order). 

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{Essay}
 
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item{First, you have to be able to identify errors in grammar and diction. }
\item{Then, you look at sentences and figure out how to improve them.}  
\item{Improving Paragraphs questions take it to the next level—you read entire paragraphs and improve their style, organization, word choice, and clarity.}
\item{All of these skills-grammar, sentence clarity, organization-combine when you write your essay. }
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Here are the directions for Improving Paragraphs:}
\begin{center}
\textit{The following passage is an early draft of an essay. Some parts of the passage need to be rewritten.
Read the passage and select the best answers for the questions that follow. Some questions are about particular sentences or parts of sentences and ask you to improve sentence structure or word choice. Other questions ask you to consider organization and development. In making your decisions, follow the conventions of standard written English. In choosing answers, follow the requirements of standard written English.}
\end{center}

\bigskip
In other words, you will see the rough draft of an essay, 2-3 paragraphs (about 15 sentences) long.  Some questions will ask you to fix individual sentences; other questions will address the whole essay.


\bigskip   %skips added around these 2 lists so that are spread out and look better

\bigskip
\textbf{Improving Paragraphs asks you to think ``big picture"}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Clarity}
\item{Transitions between sentences, paragraphs, and ideas}
\item{Organization}
\item{Logical flow of ideas}
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

\bigskip
\textbf{Types of Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Sentence Revision - change or improve a sentence.}
\item{Sentence Addition - add a sentence or phrase to improve a transition or clarify meaning.}
\item{Sentence Combination - combine sentences using conjunctions or punctuation (e.g., a semi-colon)}
\item{Essay Analysis - identify main idea of an essay (they may ask you to give the essay a title) or improve its overall structure and mechanics.}
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip
\subsection{Strategy for Paragraph improvements}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Quickly read over the paragraphs and take note of the \longline any grammatical errors that you see right away because there will probably be a question about that.}
\item{Then look at the \longline}
\item{Reread the sentence in context. Read the sentence \longline and the sentence \longline the line in the question}
\item{If it is a sentence improvement question, look for the “alerts” and other errors in the Writing Multiple Choice Part I and Part II.}

\bigskip
If it is a sentence addition or move question, ask yourself, “does it fit where it is, or would it be better somewhere else?” Remember: The sentences need to be coherent. Frequently, the SAT tests this by making the first part of the sentence similar to the last part of the previous sentence (that is, discussing the same topic as the second half of the previous sentence). If it doesn't discuss the topic(s) presented in the sentences around it or otherwise seems random, it may need to be removed completely. 

\bigskip
If you think that it should stay where it is, you can re-visit the option of fixing it.  If it's a run-on, try shortening it or splitting it into two sentences.  This tests the same skills as Sentence Improvement questions.  Before you “improve” the sentence though, make sure it belongs where it is!  Always consider sentences in context.

\item{Think of \longline}

\item{Look at the answer choices.  \longline the one that comes closest to your answer.}
\end{enumerate}

\section[Improvement Practice]{SAT Worksheet 2C: Exercises for Improving Paragraphs}
\textbf{\textit{Exercise \#1: Correcting Fragments}}

\bigskip
\textit{Directions: The following is an edited passage from the 1922 book, “The Outline of Science.” Read the passage and underline the sentence fragments. Then, write how you would correct these fragments to make them complete sentences.}

\bigskip
\begin{center}
\textbf{Is there Life on Mars?}
\end{center}

\begin{spacing}{2}
\begin{linenumbers*}
\modulolinenumbers[5]
\indent The basis of this belief is that if, as we saw, all the globes in our solar system are masses of metal that are cooling down, the smaller will have cooled down before the larger, and will be further ahead in their development. Now Mars is very much smaller than the earth, and must have cooled at its surface millions of years before the earth did. Hence, if a story of life began on Mars at all. We cannot guess what sort of life-forms would be evolved in a different world, but we can confidently say that they would tend toward increasing intelligence; and thus we are disposed to look for highly intelligent beings on Mars.

\indent But this argument supposes that the conditions of life, namely air and water, are found on Mars, and it is disputed whether they are found there in sufficient quantity. The late Professor Percival Lowell, who made a lifelong study of Mars, there are hundreds of straight lines drawn across the surface of the planet, and he claimed that they are beds of vegetation marking the sites of great channels or pipes by means of which the "Martians" draw water from their polar ocean. Professor W. H. Pickering, another high authority, thinks that the lines are long, narrow marshes fed by moist winds from the poles. There are certainly white polar caps on Mars. They seem to melt in the spring, and the dark fringe around them grows broader.

\indent Other astronomers, however, say that they find no trace of water-vapor in the atmosphere of Mars, and they think that the polar caps may be simply thin sheets of hoar-frost or frozen gas. And they point out that, as the atmosphere of Mars is certainly scanty, and the distance from the sun is so great.

\indent If one asks why our wonderful instruments cannot settle these points, one must be reminded that Mars is never nearer than 34,000,000 miles from the earth, and only approaches to this distance once in fifteen or seventeen years. The image of Mars on the photographic negative taken in a big telescope is very small. Astronomers rely to a great extent on the eye, which is more sensitive than the photographic plate. But it is easy to have differences of opinion as to what the eye sees.

\indent In August, 1924, the planet again be well placed for observation, and we may learn more about it. Already a few of the much-disputed lines, which people wrongly call "canals," have been traced on photographs. Astronomers who are skeptical about life on Mars are often not fully aware of the extraordinary adaptability of life. There was a time when the climate of the whole earth, from pole to pole, was semi-tropical for millions of years. No animal could then endure the least cold, yet now we have plenty of Arctic plants and animals. If the cold came slowly on Mars, as we have reason to suppose, the population could be gradually adapted to it. On the whole, it is possible that there is advanced life on Mars, and it is not impossible, in spite of the very great difficulties of a code of communication, that our "elder brothers" may yet flash across space the solution of many of our problems.

\textbf{\textit{Exercise \#2: Transitions and Conjunctions}}
\bigskip
\textit{Directions: The following passage is taken from a student's persuasive essay advocating for a politician's support of Bill 1914 mandating driver's test for elderly drivers. Read the passage and write an appropriate transition word or phrase in the blanks.}

\begin{spacing}{2}
\begin{linenumbers*}
\modulolinenumbers[5]
\indent As a recently permitted driver, I have become familiar with some of the laws that the Massachusetts State Legislature has enacted in an attempt to curb the number of accidents involving teen drivers. These admirable bills have saved the lives of the state's children and made the roads safer for all drivers and passengers, not to mention pedestrians.\longline, it is of grave concern that there is currently very little regulation of the age group with the second highest number of motor vehicle crashes, the elderly (age sixty-five and older). The passage of proposed Bill 1914 will mandate that ``the registrar shall require that all persons aged 85 or older who are seeking to renew their operator's licenses take a vision and road test before being reissued such license". \longline I am writing to urge your support for this precedent-setting bill.

\indent Those unfit to operate a vehicle are literally “accidents waiting to happen”, jeopardizing their own lives and endangering public safety when they operate an automobile. According to the Governor's Highway Safety Bureau, older drivers were involved in 18,743 crashes in Massachusetts in 2002 \longline this age group was responsible for over 12\% of all motor vehicle fatalities. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that these statistics continue to rise steadily \longline the number of traffic-related deaths in the general population decline.

\indent Opponents of this bill may argue that since few elderly people are licensed to drive, they do not pose a serious threat on the road. This is an oversimplification \longline the number of seniors driving in Massachusetts totaled more than 858,000 in 2000. The aging of the Baby Boom generation \longline medical advancements have contributed to an increase in elderly drivers. \longline these problems can only escalate, as the National Institute on Aging predicts that in 30 years, the number of drivers over the age of eighty-five will be five times greater than today. Using this conservative estimate of the number of drivers and current accident rates, it is forecasted that this increase in population will result in the tripling of traffic fatalities caused by this age group.\longline legislation passed now will lower preventable deaths and will also have widespread implications for the future.

\indent Currently, the only people that are required to have their vision checked are first time license applicants and those persons renewing their licenses at a Registry branch. People of any age who renew their license online are exempt from this personal screening. This is relevant information \longline researchers at the University of Alabama concurred with a 1995 Johns Hopkins University study which found that state-mandated vision tests of elderly drivers are successful in lowering their accident rate.

\indent \longline Bill 1914 does not seek to deprive elders of their independence by mandating that senior citizens forfeit their license at a certain age; \hrulefill,

the bill assures that those who choose to drive are able to safely do so.

\textit{Directions: The following is taken from a newspaper article about paying for college. Cross out any words or phrases that you feel are redundant or should be moved in the essay.}

\begin{spacing}{2}
\begin{center}
\textbf{Show Me the Money: Getting Money For College}
\end{center}

\begin{linenumbers*}
\modulolinenumbers[5]
\indent College in the United States is extremely expensive. With tuition costing as much as \$60,000 per year, many parents and students are worried about paying for college. There are many opportunities for students to get money for school from outside organizations, government agencies, and the particular university that they hope to attend. Students can get grants or scholarships that do not have to be paid back in addition to loans, which students begin to pay back after graduation. For example, a student named Ben Kaplan was so worried about paying for Harvard that he wrote scholarship essays that earned him over \$90,000 for college.

\indent Students don't have to be the valedictorian or a star quarterback, in fact, lots of qualities, interests, and affiliations will make students eligible. Lots of different students can get money for college! Many organizations, including companies, non-profits, and unique heritage groups, award scholarships—there are scholarships for almost everything. Parents and students should start searching early in the college process and not wait until the last minute. There are national contests for high school writers, historians, and scientists, such as the Ayn Rand Essay Contests, National History Day Contest, and Intel International Science and Engineering Fair. There are many online resources such as finaid.org and fastweb.com to help students find scholarships. Students can search for books about obtaining money for college, such as How to Go to College Almost for Free, at local libraries, bookstores, and high school guidance departments.  Students can also call local businesses and associations and ask if they have any scholarships or contests with prize money.  Some national groups have awards as well.

\indent In order to get federally backed loans from their university, students need to fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FASFA) online. Each college also gives out a certain number of merit-based scholarships to attract students to their schools. After filling out the FASFA, students are sent the Student Aid Report (SAR).  Colleges use the SAT to determine student's financial aid package, that is to say colleges use this to estimate how much money a student's family can contribute to tuition and how much money a student is able to borrow. The best way to get this type of scholarship is to have a high GPA and SAT score relative to the current freshman class. Strong students are awarded merit-based scholarships. Students can also ask about the number and amount of merit-based scholarships that by calling the school or asking an admissions officer during their college visit. With scholarships and financial aid, it 'pays' to plan!

\textbf\textit{Exercise \#5:Dividing an Essay into Paragraphs}
\bigskip
\textit{Directions:The following is taken from student's essay contrasting the works of Robert Frost and Thylias Moss. Read the passage and decide where the sentences should be divided to in order to create four distinct paragraphs. }

\begin{spacing}{2}
\begin{linenumbers*}
\modulolinenumbers[5]
\indent The poetry of Robert Frost and Thylias Moss were influenced by different events, which attributed to the contrasting attitudes toward similar subjects in their poetry.  Frost, living in New England, was influenced by serenity and breathtaking scenes of nature. His poem, “Stopping By Woods on a Snowy Evening” epitomizes this, as the Speaker desperately desires to watch the woods fill up with snow, but regretfully acknowledges that he must continue on his journey before he can rest. With thoughts of the beauty of his home, Frost's mood is joyous. Not all poets, however, are as agreeable as he. When writing “Interpretation of A Poem By Frost”, Thylias Moss describes the filling up of woods with snow through the bleak perspective of a young African American girl. In both poems, diction and imagery work collaboratively to establish the two dissimilar tones of the authors. While Frost's attitude towards the metaphorical woods is cheery and appreciative, Moss's seems to be angry and frustrated. In creating the different tones of voice, Frost and Moss utilize contrasting choices of words. Frost utilizes passive diction, “easy wind and downy flake”, as well as end rhymes to create a pleasant atmosphere. The rhymes make the poem flow smoothly and the words sound gentle, pleasing to the ear. These combine to produce a lighter mood than in the poem by Moss. 

\indent The latter author employs words such as “inter”, “emptiness”, “polarity”, “edge” (synonymous for sharp), and “defiance”. The use of these harsh words verifies her feelings toward the subject as angry. The most apparent difference in diction, however, are the words chosen to describe the animal. Frost playfully calls the creature a “little horse” who shakes his harness bells when the Speaker stops to look at the woods. Moss refers to it as a “limited audience”, and believes the girl's efforts of defiance to be wasted on something so unworthy as a horse. Frost's lively description of the horse and entire scene contrasts Moss's degrading and cruel one, representative of Frost's relaxed tones and the overwhelming frustration felt by Moss. Both authors employ imagery and the connotations of words to establish the different emotions. Frost describes the environment: woods lovely, dark, and deep, and the frozen lake. In the background, the snow falls down softly, and the only noises are peaceful, that of a light wind and downy flake, and horse bells jingling merrily. After reading this, many imagine a peaceful scene, one which could easily be set during winter holidays (which also conjure feelings of great pleasure). On the other hand, Moss paints an entirely different picture of the landscape. In her poem, the girl is surrounded by an aura of emptiness- not welcome and serene like the former poem- but eerie and frightening. She views as the snow “inters the grass”, which for the readers results in many visualizing violent images of the snow relentlessly beating on the frail grass. Moss uses these morose images to establish her attitude towards the poem, while Frost's jovial illustrations reflect his serene attitude. The Speakers of both poems experience different metaphorical journeys, and the tones of the authors on current issues in the poems significantly affect their views of the future. The work “Stopping By Woods on a Snowy Evening” ends with the lines, “I have miles to go before I sleep, I have miles to go before I sleep”. This suggests the Speaker still has things to accomplish in his life; yet, impacted by Frost's appreciative and joyous temperament, he believes the rest of the journey- the future- will also be something to be enjoyed, as beautiful as the woods described in the beginning of the piece. While Frost's feelings of the present-day imply the future will be pleasurable, Moss's frustration continues. Moss reflects on society, believing there are, “miles to go, more than the distance from Africa to Andover, more than the distance from black to white before she sleeps with Jim”. Moss's anger stemming from prejudice influences her to predict a bleak future; she believes that racism will still be a problem, as she has observed that diverse peoples seem unwilling to cooperate and tolerate each other. The overall meaning of “Stopping By Woods on a Snowy Evening”, authored by an optimistic Robert Frost, is one should appreciate life- now and in the future; however, Thylias Moss's contrasting tone of anger and frustration expresses the challenges of a young African American, and implies unless drastic social measures are taken, intolerance will only continue.

(3) In this age of technology, we might also think of the security of personal information we put on the internet or the credit card information we give to make purchases. (4) Issues of privacy pervade more areas of our lives than we might initially imagine. (5) An example of this is the privacy policies of hospitals.

\indent (6) Hospitals are liable anytime patient privacy is violated. (7) Hospitals protect patient information as much as possible. (8) Any papers containing sensitive information are shredded and disposed of carefully when necessary. (9) Employees are expected to honor patient confidentiality and are not allowed to talk about their patients outside the hospital. (10) In the same way, lawyers uphold the same standards of privacy with their clients. (11) If patient privacy is disregarded, the consequences can be severe. (12) Big fines must be paid and dismissal from one's post is highly probable. (13) Because most employees cannot afford to face these consequences, they take great care not to violate the hospital's privacy policies.

\section{About the SAT Essay}
The SAT essay asks you to present your point of view and support it with examples.  You will usually receive a short excerpt or quote.  Your assignment follows the prompt.  You are asked to support your opinion using reasoning and examples from your reading, studies, experiences, or observations.

\bigskip
You can use examples from…
\begin{itemize}
\item{Literature, describing a character or a theme from a book you understand well and about which you feel comfortable writing.}  
\item{History, describing an event or movement.}
\item{Current events}
\item{Politics}
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
If you are having trouble thinking of more “academic” examples, then you can use...
\begin{itemize}
\item{Literature, describing a character or a theme from a book you understand well and about which you feel comfortable writing.}  
\item{Personal experience - it is okay to use “I”}
\item{Experience of a friend or relative}
\item{Anything that is relevant and will support your point of view!}
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
It is difficult to brainstorm examples on the spot, and students that come prepared with a few strong examples that can be adjusted to answer several different assignments have a major advantage. This is why we will be brainstorming examples later in this class. 

\bigskip
SAT graders are looking for effective writing with a logical and consistent expression of ideas and an insightful, well-supported point of view.

\bigskip
\textit{**Note: it is usually better to “choose a side.”  It is easier to support one point of view than defend both sides of an issue.  It is possible to write a strong essay this way, but it makes your job harder!**}

\section{How an SAT Essay is Scored}
Each essay is independently scored by two readers on a scale from 1 to 6. These readers' scores are combined to produce the 2-12 scale. The essay readers are experienced and trained high school and college teachers.
If the two readers' scores differ by more than one point (a rare situation), a third reader scores the essay.

\section[Scoring]{SAT Worksheet 2D: Practice Scoring an SAT Essay}
\textit{Directions: Read the following assignment and essay response written in 25 minutes. Then, answer the questions that follow.}

\bigskip
Assignment: Do changes in our lives necessarily make them better? Plan and write an essay in which you develop your point of view on this issue.  Support your position with reasoning and examples taken from your reading, studies, experience, or observations.

\bigskip
\indent In the 18th century, many women were burdened with the difficult task of washing clothes by hand. While some women may have taken pride in this task, the invention of the washing machine enabled these women to spend more time with other tasks and move beyond household chores. While this is an example of how changes that make our lives easier can also make them better, it is not always true that the changes that make our lives easier do not always improve them.\\

\indent The research surrounding household appliances-including that presented in the book, “The World is Fat”-demonstrates that while housekeeping luxuries have made our lives easier have not necessarily improved them. For example, an advantage of appliances such as washers and dryers have made our lives easier because they have decreased the average time that an American adult spends on household chores per day. However, this progress is a double-edged sword because in decreasing the amount of time spent on tasks such as cleaning floors and washing dishes, these devices have also decreased the amount of calories that Americans burn while completing these tasks. “The World is Fat” author bemoans this as a major contributing factor to obesity crisis in America. Since calories can be correlated with amount of time on chores, it is clear that household appliances have come with a Catch-22. \\

\indent In addition to household appliances, another aspect of modern technology, social media, have made our lives easier without becoming purely better. While social media has made it more convenient to communicate with our friends, it has also been the source of many problems. For example, an issue prevalent in the lives of many American teenagers is cyber-bullying. Social media sites such as Facebook have enabled students to tease or harass other students. This situation is detrimental to the mental health of both the bully and the bullied students. As a result, in making communication between people easier, social media has had unintended consequences, such as cyberbulling, that do not necessarily improve our lives. \\

\indent In analyzing the effects of household appliances and social media, it is clear that easy does not always facilitate improved well being. This leads me to believe that when inventors and other innovators are considering bringing a product to market, they should consider the question of “will this thing help others?” in addition to the consideration of whether or not it will make other's lives easier. Consideration of both of these questions could help to safeguard American society.

\section{Transition Words}
Effective use of transitional words and phrases enhances the flow and consistency of your essay. 

\bigskip
Transitions help papers read more smoothly and strengthen connections between ideas.  Just as topic sentences help link your examples back to your thesis statement, transitions also act as the “glue” that binds your ideas together and keeps your entire essay focused and on-topic.

\section{Sentence Completions}
There are 19 Sentence Completion questions on the SATs.  You get one point for each correct answer, minus ¼ point for each incorrect answer, and no points for answers left blank. Each Sentence Completion question has one blank or two blanks and asks you to choose the word(s) that best fits the meaning of the sentence as a whole.  Each sentence should take less than a minute to answer.

\bigskip
To answer these questions, you need to know the definitions of the vocabulary words, as well as how the words are used in the context of the sentence.  Understanding sentence logic and studying vocabulary is key to doing well on Sentence Completions.  

\bigskip
Each sentence completion will give you at least one clue as to what word belongs in the blank. For example, some sentence completion questions contain two clauses, separated by a comma (,), semicolon (;), or a colon (:).  One clause has the blanks, while the other provides a definition with descriptions or synonyms.

\bigskip
Transition words (like but, although, however, yet, even though) are very important.  They indicate a shift in ideas.  

\bigskip
For example:  Although the film showed scenes of \underline{violence}, its ultimate message was one of \underline{peace}.  

\bigskip
\textit{In this example, what does the transitional word \textit{although} indicate about the relationship between the two vocabulary words, “violence” and “peace”?}

\textbf{There are 4 commonly used types of sentence completions:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \longline which describes a word and wants you to choose the word from the answer choices.
\item \longline which wants you to look for antonyms or descriptions that give the opposite meaning to the answers. Signal words for this type includes:

\longline, \longline, \longline,

\longline, \longline.
\item \longline which establishes a causal relationship between the two parts of the sentence. Signal words for this type includes: \longline,

\longline, \longline,

\longline, \longline.
\item \longline, which wants you to find a similar word for the words given. Signal words for this type includes: \longline, \longline, and \longline.
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip
\textbf{Definitional:}\\
Some cynics think that America is an \longline, a power structure in which a relative few rule the entire nation.

\bigskip
We are looking for a word whose definition is ``a power structure in which a relative few rule the entire nation."\\
The answer could be ``oligarchy."

\bigskip
\textbf{Contrast:}\\
The students worked \longline, helping one another to complete their projects.

\bigskip
In this example, the clauses are separated by a comma.  The second clause describes how the students were working.  It gives a definition.  The blank needs a word that means the students were helping one another.  
The answer could be a word like cooperatively or collaboratively.  

\bigskip

\textbf{Cause and Effect:}\\
After several inconclusive and unpredictable experiments, the scientist had to admit he was \longline about the effects of the new medicine.

\bigskip
Since the experiments did not prove anything and had unpredictable outcomes, the scientist cannot be certain about the medicine's effects.
The answer could be something like ``uncertain" or ``unsure."

\bigskip
\textbf{Synonyms:}\\
Both \longline and \longline, Brenda could always be found talking and laughing.

\bigskip
This example also provides a description or definition.  Keep in mind parallel structure.  The first blank should have something to do with Brenda always talking, while the second goes with her laughing.  
The answers could be something like ``chatty and good-humored."

\section[Strategies]{Strategies for Completing Sentence Completions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Read the \longline. Look for \longline and words that \longline or are \longline or

\longline of the word that goes in the blank. The goal of this is to figure out the relationship between the \longline and the rest of the sentence.}

\bigskip
Then, write your \longline in the blank. You will try to match this to the answer choices.

\bigskip
\textbf{But what should you do if can't figure out your own word to put in the blank?}

\bigskip
{If you need help writing a word to go in the blank, try to determine what

\longline of sentence completion it is. This can then help you identify \longline words. You can also evaluate the \longline of the word by asking yourself, ``Should a positive-, negative- or neutral-sounding word go in the blank?''}

\item{Read the answer choices and \longline the answers that you know are wrong, either because you know the definition of the word or because it has the incorrect \longline.}\\  Afterwards, mark the \longline that is closest to the word you had in the blank.

\textbf{But what should you do if you don't know the meaning of one or more of the answer choices?}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
\item Determine if the word in the blank should have a \longline,

\longline, or \longline connotation. Then, determine the \longline of each of the answer choices and

\longline the ones that have the wrong connotation.

\item To figure out the definition of an unfamiliar word, think about where you may have seen or \longline it used before. This will help you to define the word or label a connotation.

\item You can also use \longline, \longline, or

\longline to get an idea of what the unfamiliar word means.

\item If you can not eliminate two or more of the answer choices, then you should

\longline it and come back to it later.
\end{enumerate}

\item{If there is a sentence completion question with \longline blanks, use the strategies in steps 1-2 to \longline and then eliminate words for the \longline blank. With the answer choices remaining, use the strategies in steps 1-2 to create your own word for the blank and  \longline eliminate words for the second blank.}

\bigskip
There should be \longline answer choice remaining. If there is more than one answer choice remaining, try using the strategies in step 2 to try to eliminate the incorrect answers. 
\end{enumerate}
\pagebreak

\section[Strategies]{Summary: Sentence Completion Strategies}

\vfill\item Focus on descriptive words.  If you are looking for an adjective, what are the other adjectives (or modifiers) in the sentence?
\vfill\item Identify clue words.  Do words like although, but, however, yet, even though indicate that the two clauses have contrasting or conflicting meanings?
\vfill\item Cross out answers that are obviously wrong.
\vfill\item Above all, learn your vocabulary.  The SATs strongly emphasize vocabulary.  Your understanding of word definitions is key to doing well on Sentence Completion questions.

\section{SAT worksheet 1F: Warm-up}
\textit{Directions: Turn your textbook to a passage-based reading section. Use this to help you answer the questions below.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the structure of the types of passages seen in the critical reading section? (e.g. short passages)
\vfill\item What types of questions are being asked about the passages?
\vfill\item Introduction to critical reading strategy \#1: Look at a long passage. What do you notice about the line numbers of the questions following the long passage?
\end{enumerate}

\vfill
\newpage
\section[Reading Questions]{Reading Comprehension and Passage-Based Reading\\ Questions}
Besides Sentence Completions, the Critical Reading section of the SATs is composed of passage-based reading questions.  The passages can range from about 100 to 850 words.  They are drawn from a wide range of sources, including natural sciences, literary fiction, and social studies.  

\bigskip
Critical Reading questions test your understanding of the written word and your ability to read carefully and analytically.  They also test your vocabulary.  Some questions are based on a single passage, while other questions ask you to compare and contrast two related questions, usually based around the same topic or theme.

\bigskip
When reading the passages, it is important to read actively.  Keep in mind that you will be answering questions about the purpose and tone of the passage.  Take note of the style and content—is it fact-based or opinion-based?  Some students benefit from skimming the questions before reading the passage so you know what to look for. Reading as much as you can is the best way to improve your reading comprehension skills and expand your vocabulary.

\bigskip
The questions about the passages will generally go in order that they appear in the passage. There are four main types of questions:

\begin{itemize}
\item Main idea
\item Details
\item Inferences
\item Tone
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
\textbf{Main idea questions} generally ask you about the purpose or central theme of a passage.

\bigskip
\textbf{Detail questions} usually refer you to a specific line and ask you to explain a phrase or define a vocabulary word in context.

\bigskip
\textbf{Inference questions} require your analytical skills to come into play.  Based on the reading, what conclusions can you draw?  Make sure these conclusions could be supported with evidence directly from the reading.

\bigskip
\textbf{Tone questions} ask about the narrator's attitude.  Try to hear the author's voice in your head.  If you were reading the excerpt out loud, how would it sound? 

\bigskip
\textit{Keep in mind that the answers come directly from the passages.  Even if you have pre-existing knowledge about a subject, you must answer based on the reading! Therefore, it is important to always go back to the passage to find evidence for the correct answer. This is EXTREMELY important and this will come up over and over again in this chapter.}

\newpage
\section[Reading the Passage]{Strategies for Reading the Passage}

\underline{Method \#1: Read the entire passage}

Some people will read entire passage (they may or may not read the questions first), underlining and making short notes on passage and then answer the questions. 

\bigskip
\begin{enumerate}
\item What do you think are the benefits to this method?
\vfill\item What are the drawbacks to this method?
\end{enumerate}


\vfill
\underline{Method \#2: Back and Forth Method}

In the passage-based reading section, the questions are arranged by the order in which they refer to the passage not by their level of difficulty. Therefore, you can read the first question, see what the line number is in this question and read the beginning of the passage to two line numbers after the question. Then, answer the question. See where the line number in the next question is and then read from where you left off to slightly after the line number of the question. Read to there and then answer the question. The evidence for the correct answer in questions without line numbers can usually be found in between the line numbers listed in the question before and the question after it. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Repeat reading the question, reading a part of the text, and answering the question until all you have left are questions about the passage as a whole. Complete these at the end when you have finished the passage.

\begin{enumerate}
\item What do you think are the benefits to this method?
\vfill\item What are the drawbacks to this method?

\section[Anticipating the Passage]{SAT Worksheet Practice 2F: Anticipating the Passage}
\textit{Directions: Read the following italicized passages that would appear before a passage. Then, answer the questions that follow.}

\bigskip
\textit{The following passage is from a neurosurgeon's autobiography recalling a discussion on alternative medicine.}\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item What do you think that the doctor's perspective will be throughout the passage? \hrulefill  \\
\item What point of view, if expressed in the passage, would suprise you? Why? \hrulefill \\
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip
\textit{The following passage is from an article entitled, ``Is your child busy all day?: a manifesto for unstructured play''}\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item What topic do you think will be discussed in the article? \hrulefill
\item What perspective to you think the author will take on this topic? \hrulefill
\end{enumerate}

\newpage
\section[Passage-Based Section]{Strategies for Answering the Passage-Based Reading Section}

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=0cm,labelwidth=\itemindent,labelsep=0cm,align=left,label={\bfseries Strategy \#\arabic*:\ }]
\item Do not use your own \longline or

\longline to answer the questions. You must only use the information presented in \longline. (This can be harder than it seems!)
\item Use \longline from the passage in order to select the correct answer.

\bigskip
\item Good hints for the correct answer can often be found around the line numbers give for a question. Therefore, if you are reading a question with line number, make sure to carefully read a little \longline and a little \longline each question.  

\bigskip
\item Before reading the answer choices, think about your \longline to the question. This will help you to not get distracted by trick answers or answers that are “sort of” right. 

\bigskip
\item For each question, you are looking for the \longline possible answer. Sometimes, an answer choice might be ``sort of" right. It can be tempting to pick these types of answer choices, but usually there is a better answer choice. The correct answer choice must have evidence from the text, so you should not have to ``stretch" what you think is the correct answer.

\bigskip
\item Also remember that the SAT is trying to trick you by writing answer choices with information stated in the passage but that is \longline to the question (see main reasons why SAT passage-based answer choices are wrong, later in this section). If you are still having trouble, \longline it for now and come back to it after you have answered the general questions about the passage. 

\bigskip
\item If you are having trouble finding the correct answer, eliminating

\longline answers or asking yourself ``is this answer wrong and why" for each answer choice can be easier than finding the \longline answer right away.

\bigskip
\item After you are finished with the passage, you will want to think about the

\longline and other elements of the passage and the feelings conveyed in it. This will help you to answer the questions, particularly about the passage overall or the tone of the passage. 

\centerline{\textbf{Think about an APE saying O!}}

\textbf{About.} What is the passage about? What is the main point or argument? 

\bigskip
\textbf{Purpose.} Why is the author writing this text? What the purpose?

\bigskip
\textbf{Expressing Attitude.} How does the author's attitude towards the topic relate to the main idea or point being made? How does the author use language, sentence structure, and rhetorical devices, such as similes and metaphors to express his/her attitude towards the topic

\bigskip
\textbf{Overall feeling (mood).} What does the reader feel towards the topic after reading the passage? 

\bigskip
\item When you get a question wrong, understand why the answer you originally chose is wrong in addition to finding evidence from the passage for the line number. To help you, we have a list of five reasons why incorrect answer choices are wrong on the next page.

\indent Candide, all stupefied, could not yet very well realise how he was a hero. He resolved one fine day in spring to go for a walk, marching straight before him, believing that it was a privilege of the human as well as of the animal species to make use of their legs as they pleased. He had advanced two leagues when he was overtaken by four others, heroes of six feet, who bound him and carried him to a dungeon. He was asked which he would like the best, to be whipped six-and-thirty times through all the regiment, or to receive at once twelve balls of lead in his brain. He vainly said that human will is free, and that he chose neither the one nor the other. He was forced to make a choice; he determined, in virtue of that gift of God called liberty, to run the gauntlet six-and-thirty times. He bore this twice. The regiment was composed of two thousand men; that composed for him four thousand strokes, which laid bare all his muscles and nerves, from the \textbf{nape} of his neck quite down to his rump. As they were going to proceed to a third whipping, Candide, able to bear no more, begged as a favour that they would be so good as to shoot him. He obtained this favour; they bandaged his eyes, and bade him kneel down. The King of the Bulgarians passed at this moment and ascertained the nature of the crime. As he had great talent, he understood from all that he learnt of Candide that he was a young metaphysician, extremely ignorant of the things of this world, and he accorded him his pardon with a clemency which will bring him praise in all the journals, and throughout all ages.

\indent In this manner, the mysterious old Roger Chillingworth became the medical adviser of the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale. As not only the disease interested the physician, but he was strongly moved to look into the character and qualities of the patient, these two men, so different in age, came gradually to spend much time together. For the sake of the minister's health, and to enable the leech to gather plants with healing balm in them, they took long walks on the sea-shore, or in the forest; mingling various walks with the splash and murmur of the waves, and the solemn wind-anthem among the tree-tops. Often, likewise, one was the guest of the other in his place of study and retirement. There was a fascination for the minister in the company of the man of science, in whom he recognised an intellectual cultivation of no moderate depth or scope; together with a range and freedom of ideas, that he would have \textbf{vainly} looked for among the members of his own profession. In truth, he was startled, if not shocked, to find this attribute in the physician.

\indent Mr. Dimmesdale was a true priest, a true religionist, with the reverential sentiment largely developed, and an order of mind that impelled itself powerfully along the track of a creed, and wore its passage continually deeper with the lapse of time. In no state of society would he have been what is called a man of liberal views; it would always be essential to his peace to feel the pressure of a faith about him, supporting, while it confined him within its iron framework. Not the less, however, though with a tremulous enjoyment, did he feel the occasional relief of looking at the universe through the \textbf{medium} of another kind of intellect than those with which he habitually held converse. It was as if a window were thrown open, admitting a freer atmosphere into the close and stifled study, where his life was wasting itself away, amid lamp-light, or obstructed day-beams, and the musty fragrance, be it sensual or moral, that exhales from books. But the air was too fresh and chill to be long breathed with comfort. So the minister, and the physician with him, withdrew again within the limits of what their Church defined as orthodox.

\indent Thus Roger Chillingworth scrutinised his patient carefully, both as he saw him in his ordinary life, keeping an accustomed pathway in the range of thoughts familiar to him, and as he appeared when thrown amidst other moral scenery, the novelty of which might call out something new to the surface of his character. He deemed it essential, it would seem, to know the man, before attempting to do him good. Wherever there is a heart and an intellect, \textbf{the diseases of the physical frame are tinged with the peculiarities of these.} In Arthur Dimmesdale, thought and imagination were so active, and sensibility so intense, that the bodily infirmity would be likely to have its groundwork there. So Roger Chillingworth--the man of skill, the kind and friendly physician--strove to go deep into his patient's bosom, delving among his principles, prying into his recollections, and probing everything with a cautious touch, like a treasure-seeker in a dark cavern.

\section[Tone and Inference]{Strategies for Answering Tone and Inference Questions}
You should be engaged with the text as you read, asking questions, absorbing information, and determining its purpose.
Inference questions ask you to draw conclusions and make evaluations and inferences.  These kinds of questions require you to go beyond reading and understanding the text—they ask you to interpret and come to a conclusion through reasoning.

\bigskip
Words like probably, apparently, seems, suggests, it can be inferred, and the author implies usually indicate that it is an extended reasoning question. When there are two passages, both are based on a shared issue or theme.  The two authors either contradict, support, or complement each other's point of view. Usually Two Passage questions will ask you to interpret point of view, tone, style, or attitude.

\bigskip
The italicized headnote at the beginning may help you make a prediction as to tone and style.  If the introduction says the excerpt was adapted from a scientific article, you may expect that the tone is dry, neutral, informational, clinical, etc.  If it is excerpted from a book by Mark Twain, you can guess that it may be humorous, mocking, satirical, witty, and wordy.

\bigskip
Tone can usually be determined by looking at the specific details and words of a passage. What adjectives are used to describe a person or verbs explain how he/she moves or talks?

\bigskip
Is the wording formal or informal, elevated or lowbrow, academic or colloquial?  Notice any details that jump out as odd—for example, an author refers to a character as a wolf-why would (s)he do that?

\bigskip
Try to hear the author's voice in your head.  If you were reading the excerpt out loud, how would it sound? 

\bigskip
Usually with tone questions, you will be able to easily eliminate one or more choices because they are way off.  Generally, the writers are moderate in their opinions.  Extreme tones like outraged, despairing, or overjoyed usually are not correct. See the tone words commonly used on the SATs in the last chapter of this document.

Pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one's cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied. Three times Della counted it. One dollar and eighty-seven cents. And the next day would be Christmas.

\indent They turned on themselves, like a feverish wheel, all tumbling spokes. Margot stood alone. She was a very frail girl who looked as if she had been lost in the rain for years and the rain had washed out the blue from her eyes and the red from her mouth and the yellow from her hair. She was an old photograph dusted from an album, whitened away, and if she spoke at all her voice would be a ghost. Now she stood, separate, staring at the rain and the loud wet world beyond the huge glass.
``What're you looking at ?" said William.

Margot said nothing.

``Speak when you're spoken to."

\indent He gave her a shove. But she did not move; rather she let herself be moved only by him and nothing else. They edged away from her, they would not look at her. She felt them go away. And this was because she would play no games with them in the echoing tunnels of the underground city. If they tagged her and ran, she stood blinking after them and did not follow. When the class sang songs about happiness and life and games her lips barely moved. Only when they sang about the sun and the summer did her lips move as she watched the drenched windows.

\indent And then, of course, the biggest crime of all was that she had come here only five years ago from Earth, and she remembered the sun and the way the sun was and the sky was when she was four in Ohio. And they, they had been on Venus all their lives, and they had been only two years old when last the sun came out and had long since forgotten the color and heat of it and the way it really was.

\indent But Margot remembered.

\indent ``It's like a penny," she said once, eyes closed.

\indent ``No it's not!" the children cried.

\indent ``It's like a fire," she said, ``in the stove."

Furthermore, understanding why the incorrect answers are incorrect can also alert you to the answer choices that the SAT question writers will use to try get you to select the incorrect answers. 

\bigskip
\textbf{Why Incorrect SAT Answer Choices on the Reading Sections are Wrong}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Too Broad/Require too much of a leap:} Sometimes the passage is about a specific example (like a mammal) and then the answer choice will be \longline (like about animals). The answer choice might feel right or that the statement may be something the author would agree with, but it is usually not the best answer. 

\item \textbf{Too narrow:} This type of choice might be

\longline in the text, but doesn't completely answer the question. This is common in questions about the \longline of the passage.

\item \textbf{Too Extreme:} The SATs want to test how carefully you can read and

\longline a text. Therefore, words like \longline,

\longline, \longline, \longline, and \longline are probably not good choices. 


\item \textbf{Not Stated in the Passage:} The answer choice is not \longline anywhere in the passage or is \longline to the passage. This type of answer choice could make sense, but is not close enough to what is said in the passage. 

\item \textbf{True but unrelated to the Question:} This type of answer choice might be

\longline and \longline but it doesn't

\longline the question.

\textit{From Kate Chopin's 1899 novel, The Awakening}

\bigskip
\begin{linenumbers*}
\modulolinenumbers[5]
\indent Her marriage to Leonce Pontellier was purely an accident, in this respect resembling many other marriages which masquerade as the decrees of Fate. It was in the midst of her secret great passion that she met him. He fell in love, as men are in the habit of doing, and pressed his suit with an earnestness and an ardor which left nothing to be desired. He pleased her; his absolute devotion flattered her. She fancied there was a sympathy of thought and taste between them, in which fancy she was mistaken. Add to this the violent opposition of her father and her sister Margaret to her marriage with a Catholic, and we need seek no further for the motives which led her to accept Monsieur Pontellier for her husband.

\indent The acme of bliss, which would have been a marriage with the tragedian, was not for her in this world. As the devoted wife of a man who worshiped her, she felt she would take her place with a certain dignity in the world of reality, closing the portals forever behind her upon the realm of romance and dreams.

\indent But it was not long before the tragedian had gone to join the cavalry officer and the engaged young man and a few others; and Edna found herself face to face with the realities. She grew fond of her husband, realizing with some unaccountable satisfaction that no trace of passion or excessive and fictitious warmth colored her affection, thereby threatening its dissolution.

\indent She was fond of her children in an uneven, impulsive way. She would sometimes gather them passionately to her heart; she would sometimes forget them. The year before they had spent part of the summer with their grandmother Pontellier in Iberville. Feeling secure regarding their happiness and welfare, she did not miss them except with an occasional intense longing. Their absence was a sort of relief, though she did not admit this, even to herself. It seemed to free her of a responsibility which she had blindly assumed and for which Fate had not fitted her.

\indent Edna did not reveal so much as all this to Madame Ratignolle that summer day when they sat with faces turned to the sea. But a good part of it escaped her. She had put her head down on Madame Ratignolle's shoulder. She was flushed and felt intoxicated with the sound of her own voice and the unaccustomed taste of candor. It muddled her like wine, or like a first breath of freedom.

\textit{From Douglas Adams's novel A Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy}

\bigskip
\begin{linenumbers*}
\modulolinenumbers[5]
\indent The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy has a few things to say on the subject of towels. 

\indent A towel, it says, is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitch hiker can have. Partly it has great practical value - you can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea vapours; you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a mini raft down the slow heavy river Moth; wet it for use in hand-to-hand-combat; wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or to avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (a mind-boggingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it, it can't see you - daft as a bush, but very ravenous); you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough.

\indent More importantly, a towel has immense psychological value. For some reason, if a strag (strag: non-hitch hiker) discovers that a hitch hiker has his towel with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a toothbrush, face flannel, soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat spray, wet weather gear, space suit etc., etc. Furthermore, the strag will then happily lend the hitch hiker any of these or a dozen other items that the hitch hiker might accidentally have "lost". What the strag will think is that any man who can hitch the length and breadth of the galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggle against terrible odds, win through, and still knows where his towel is is clearly a man to be reckoned with.

\textit{From NYTimes columnist David Brooks's The Art of Focus}

\bigskip
\begin{linenumbers*}
\modulolinenumbers[5]
\indent Like everyone else, I am losing the attention war. I toggle over to my emails when I should be working. I text when I should be paying attention to the people in front of me. I spend hours looking at mildly diverting stuff on YouTube. (“Look, there's a bunch of guys who can play ‘Billie Jean' on beer bottles!”) 

\indent And, like everyone else, I've nodded along with the prohibition sermons imploring me to limit my information diet. Stop multitasking! Turn off the devices at least once a week!

\indent And, like everyone else, these sermons have had no effect. Many of us lead lives of distraction, unable to focus on what we know we should focus on. According to a survey reported in an Op-Ed article on Sunday in The Times by Tony Schwartz and Christine Porath, 66 percent of workers aren't able to focus on one thing at a time. Seventy percent of employees don't have regular time for creative or strategic thinking while at work.

\indent Since the prohibition sermons don't work, I wonder if we might be able to copy some of the techniques used by the creatures who are phenomenally good at learning things: children.

\indent I recently stumbled across an interview in The Paris Review with Adam Phillips, who was a child psychologist for many years. First, Phillips says, in order to pursue their intellectual adventures, children need a secure social base:
``There's something deeply important about the early experience of being in the presence of somebody without being impinged upon by their demands, and without them needing you to make a demand on them. And that this creates a space internally into which one can be absorbed. In order to be absorbed one has to feel sufficiently safe, as though there is some shield, or somebody guarding you against dangers such that you can ‘forget yourself' and absorb yourself, in a book, say."

\indent Second, before they can throw themselves into their obsessions, children are propelled by desires so powerful that they can be frightening. ``One of the things that is interesting about children is how much appetite they have," Phillips observes. “How much appetite they have - but also how conflicted they can be about their appetites. Anybody who's got young children \ldots will remember that children are incredibly picky about their food. \ldots

\indent ``One of the things it means is there's something very frightening about one's appetite. So that one is trying to contain a voraciousness in a very specific, limited, narrowed way.\ldots An appetite is fearful because it connects you with the world in very unpredictable ways. \dots Everybody is dealing with how much of their own aliveness they can bear and how much they need to anesthetize themselves."

\indent Third, children are not burdened by excessive self-consciousness: ``As young children, we listen to adults talking before we understand what they're saying. And that's, after all, where we start - we start in a position of not getting it.” Children are used to living an emotional richness that can't be captured in words. They don't worry about trying to organize their lives into neat little narratives. Their experience of life is more direct because they spend less time on interfering thoughts about themselves.

\indent The lesson from childhood, then, is that if you want to win the war for attention, don't try to say ``no" to the trivial distractions you find on the information smorgasbord; try to say ``yes" to the subject that arouses a terrifying longing, and let the terrifying longing crowd out everything else.

The way to discover a terrifying longing is to liberate yourself from the self-censoring labels you began to tell yourself over the course of your mis-education. These formulas are stultifying, Phillips argues: ``You can only recover your appetite, and appetites, if you can allow yourself to be unknown to yourself. Because the point of knowing oneself is to contain one's anxieties about appetite."

\indent Thus: Focus on the external objects of fascination, not on who you think you are. Find people with overlapping obsessions. Don't structure your encounters with them the way people do today, through brainstorming sessions (those don't work) or through conferences with projection screens.

\indent Instead look at the way children learn in groups. They make discoveries alone, but bring their treasures to the group. Then the group crowds around and hashes it out. In conversation, conflict, confusion and uncertainty can be metabolized and digested through somebody else. If the group sets a specific problem for itself, and then sets a tight deadline to come up with answers, the free digression of conversation will provide occasions in which people are surprised by their own minds.

\indent The information universe tempts you with mildly pleasant but ultimately numbing diversions. The only way to stay fully alive is to dive down to your obsessions six fathoms deep. Down there it's possible to make progress toward fulfilling your terrifying longing, which is the experience that produces the joy.

\begin{enumerate}
\item David Brooks works off the assumption that
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
\item Children lack the technical skills to access the so-called information universe.
\item People should discourage their natural obsessions so they can focus better.
\item Discoveries are best made in groups of people who gathered to brainstorm.

\begin{center}
\textbf{Woman Takes Short Half-Hour Break From Being Feminist To Enjoy TV Show}
\end{center}

\begin{linenumbers*}
\modulolinenumbers[5]
\indent Natalie Jenkins says she just wants to enjoy a little TV without thinking about how our culture repeatedly perpetuates gender stereotypes in a damaging way.

\bigskip
\indent PORTLAND, OR-Saying that she just wanted a little time to relax and ``not even think about" confining gender stereotypes, local health care industry consultant Natalie Jenkins reportedly took a 30-minute break from being a feminist last night to kick back and enjoy a television program.

\indent Jenkins, 29, told reporters that after a long and tiring day at her office, all she wanted to do was return home, sit down on her couch, turn on an episode of the TLC reality show \textit{Say Yes To The Dress}, and treat herself to a brief half hour in which she could look past all the various and near constant ways popular culture undermines the progress of women.

\indent
``Every once in a while, it's nice to watch a little television without worrying about how frequently the mainstream media perpetuates traditional gender roles," Jenkins said before putting her feet up on her coffee table and tuning in to the popular program that follows women as they shop for wedding gowns. ``No mentally cataloging all the times women are subtly mocked or shamed for not living up to an unrealistic body image, no examining how women are depicted as superficial and irrationally emotional, and no thinking about how these shows reinforce the belief that women should simply aspire to find a man and get married—none of that. Not tonight. I'm just watching an episode of Say Yes To The Dress and enjoying it for what it is."

\indent ``Between 9 and 9:30, I'm not even going to take notice of all the two-dimensional portrayals of women as fashion- and shopping-obsessed prima donnas," Jenkins added. ``That part of my brain will just be switched off."

\indent Jenkins confirmed that she watched contentedly for the entirety of the television program, telling reporters that she never once allowed herself to grow indignant as the adult, employed, and presumably self-respecting women on screen repeatedly demanded to be made into ``princesses."

\indent Additionally, Jenkins acknowledged that she witnessed dozens of moments in which the brides-to-be abandoned the notion that they should be valued for their personalities and intellects and instead seemed to derive their sole sense of worth from embellishing their appearance. However, she said she was able to consistently remind herself that this was ``Natalie time" and that the feminist movement ``could do without [her] for 30 minutes."

\indent ``Normally, I'd be pretty irritated at the thought of millions of people across the country mindlessly watching such a backward representation of what it means to be a woman in the 21st century, but tonight I'm just unwinding and not letting it get to me," Jenkins said. ``It's actually been kind of nice to push all the insinuations that marriage is the one true path for women to achieve happiness and fulfillment to the back of my mind and just lie back and have a good time." 

\indent ``In fact, there was a part where one of the brides threw a tantrum because the dress she wanted was above her budget and then whined to her father until he finally gave in and bought it for her, and I just let myself laugh out loud," added Jenkins, noting that, while she was fully aware that such depictions reinforced the notion of women as helpless figures who require a man to provide for them, she was “letting all that stuff slide” during this particular half hour. ``This show's actually pretty fun and entertaining if you ignore how damaging it could be to our perceptions of gender in society."

\indent Jenkins also reportedly viewed roughly 10 minutes of advertisements throughout the show, during which time she reminded herself to actively tune out the numerous instances wherein feminine sexuality was used to sell products; the number of times advertisements preyed on female insecurity; and the sheer volume of bare female skin shown on screen.

\indent ``Sure, I just watched several commercials that basically reduced women to explicitly sexualized objects whose sole purpose is to please men, but someone else can worry about that right now because I'm off the clock," said Jenkins, following a succession of ads for vodka, shampoo, and the Fiat 500. ``Honestly, I don't even care that that yogurt commercial showed thin, beautiful women easily balancing home and work lives while eating 60-calorie packs of yogurt. Tonight, in my mind, they're just selling Greek yogurt. That's all."

\indent While affirming that she had fully recommitted herself to the cause of gender equality as soon as the show's credits ended, Jenkins admitted she was already looking forward to the next time she could let herself disregard the many ways women are reduced to stale caricatures on national television.

\indent Honestly, it's pretty exhausting to call out every sexist stereotype or instance of misogyny in popular culture, so sometimes I have to just throw my hands up and grant myself a little time off,” Jenkins said. ``And given the state of modern media, momentarily suspending my feminist ideals is the only way to get through a night of TV without becoming totally livid or discouraged."

\indent As of press time, Jenkins' sense of relaxation and contentment had been entirely undone by the first 30 seconds of 2 Broke Girls.

\section[Strategies]{Strategies for Paired Passages}

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=0cm,labelwidth=\itemindent,labelsep=0cm,align=left,label={\bfseries Strategy \#\arabic*:\ }]
\item Read the italicized headnote at the beginning of the two passages.  This information will often have clues about the purpose, origin, writer, or setting of the excerpt.  It will help you make predictions, differentiate between the two passages, and understand the perspective of each.

\bigskip
For example, there are two passages discussing the legalization of gay marriage.  The italicized headnote tells you the first one is written by a social liberal and the second by a social conservative.  This introductory information may give you some insight into their likely stance on the topic even before reading the excerpts.  

\item The questions go in order according to how the passages are presented. 

\bigskip
Read passage 1 and answer the questions about passage 1 (the beginning questions). Read passage 2 and answer the question about the passage 2 (the middle questions). Then, think about the relationship between the passages—there will more about this in later strategies—and answer the questions about the passages together (the questions at the end).

\item The questions that ask you to analyze and evaluate the two passages and how they relate to each other will usually come closer to the end of the questions about the two passages.  When you read, ask if they agree or disagree with each other.  
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip
Another possible relationship is that the first passage introduces a topic generally while the second elaborates on it in more detail.  As you're reading, pay attention to the overall tone, purpose, and stance of the passages.

\bigskip
Some relationships between passage 1 and 2 may be characterized by the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Passage 2 provides evidence that proves the argument made in Passage 1.
\item Passage 2 elaborates on claims made in Passage 1.
\item Passage 2 exposes the flaws in the argument made in Passage 1.
\item Passage 2 provides an exception to the rule established in Passage 1.
\item Passage 2 contradicts the opinion presented in Passage 1.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
\textbf{For example, }

Passage 1: Posits that human-caused global warming will have catastrophic consequences on our environment within the next century.

Passage 2: Suggests that the earth has always gone through extreme climate changes, and global warming is similar to those that occur naturally.

\newpage
\textbf{Compare and contrast questions usually ask the following:}

\bigskip
\indent \textbf{``How would the author of passage 2 likely respond to the author of passage 1 in his claim that human activity is destroying the environment on a global scale"}- This general type of question is based on inference.  You have to interpret the authors' opinions and infer author 2's response based on the opinion (s)he presents in the excerpt.
    
\bigskip
\indent \textbf{``Which of the following is a view expressed by both passages?"}   Your answer must be closely based on the text.  Look at the answer choices and find a generalized idea that both authors would agree with.

\bigskip
\indent \textbf{``Which of the following is a difference between passage one and two?"} This is asking you to contrast the two passages.  It does not necessarily require you to make an inference, but does require that you understand the perspectives of both authors.

\textit{Susan Patton's Letter to the Editor: Advice for the young women of Princeton: the daughters I never had}

\bigskip
\begin{linenumbers*}
\modulolinenumbers[5]
\indent Forget about having it all, or not having it all, leaning in or leaning out - here's what you really need to know that nobody is telling you.

\indent For years (decades, really) we have been bombarded with advice on professional advancement, breaking through that glass ceiling and achieving work-life balance. We can figure that out - we are Princeton women. If anyone can overcome professional obstacles, it will be our brilliant, resourceful, very well-educated selves.

\indent A few weeks ago, I attended the Women and Leadership conference on campus that featured a conversation between President Shirley Tilghman and Wilson School professor Anne-Marie Slaughter, and I participated in the breakout session afterward that allowed current undergraduate women to speak informally with older and presumably wiser alumnae. I attended the event with my best friend since our freshman year in 1973. You girls glazed over at preliminary comments about our professional accomplishments and the importance of networking.

\indent Then the conversation shifted in tone and interest level when one of you asked how have Kendall and I sustained a friendship for 40 years. You asked if we were ever jealous of each other. You asked about the value of our friendship, about our husbands and children. Clearly, you don't want any more career advice. At your core, you know that there are other things that you need that nobody is addressing. A lifelong friend is one of them. Finding the right man to marry is another.

\indent When I was an undergraduate in the mid-seventies, the 200 pioneer women in my class would talk about navigating the virile plains of Princeton as a precursor to professional success. Never being one to shy away from expressing an unpopular opinion, I said that I wanted to get married and have children. It was seen as heresy.

\indent For most of you, the cornerstone of your future and happiness will be inextricably linked to the man you marry, and you will never again have this concentration of men who are worthy of you.

\indent Here's what nobody is telling you: Find a husband on campus before you graduate. Yes, I went there.

\indent I am the mother of two sons who are both Princetonians. My older son had the good judgment and great fortune to marry a classmate of his, but he could have married anyone. My younger son is a junior and the universe of women he can marry is limitless. Men regularly marry women who are younger, less intelligent, less educated. It's amazing how forgiving men can be about a woman's lack of erudition, if she is exceptionally pretty.

\indent Smart women can't (shouldn't) marry men who aren't at least their intellectual equal. As Princeton women, we have almost priced ourselves out of the market. Simply put, there is a very limited population of men who are as smart or smarter than we are. And I say again — you will never again be surrounded by this concentration of men who are worthy of you.

\indent Of course, once you graduate, you will meet men who are your intellectual equal — just not that many of them. And, you could choose to marry a man who has other things to recommend him besides a soaring intellect. But ultimately, it will frustrate you to be with a man who just isn't as smart as you.

\indent Here is another truth that you know, but nobody is talking about. As freshman women, you have four classes of men to choose from. Every year, you lose the men in the senior class, and you become older than the class of incoming freshman men. So, by the time you are a senior, you basically have only the men in your own class to choose from, and frankly, they now have four classes of women to choose from. Maybe you should have been a little nicer to these guys when you were freshmen?

\bigskip
If I had daughters, this is what I would be telling them.

\textbf{Passage 2}

\textit{Claire Fallon's The 10 Worst Pieces of Advice from Susan Patton's Marry Smart}

\bigskip
\begin{linenumbers}
\modulolinenumbers[5]
Susan Patton, also known as “The Princeton Mom,” first caught the public eye in March 2013, when she published a letter to the editor in The Daily Princetonian. The letter advised the young female students at Patton's alma mater to seek husbands while at Princeton rather than dating the lower-quality men they'd meet in their post-college lives, and to dedicate more of their time and energy to finding a good husband rather than focusing on their careers. Less than one year after that initial media circus, and several weeks after one wisely timed repeat performance in a Wall Street Journal op-ed last month, Patton has returned with a full-length book version of her original advice, Marry Smart: Advice for Finding the One. The 11-month turnaround suggests a rush to capitalize on her brush with the limelight, and indeed the quality of the book does seem as slapdash as could be expected.

\indent Of course, we could have hoped that Patton's opus, when it emerged, would be less repetitive, more polished, and less replete with awkward logical fallacies. My boyfriend, a state school grad, writes text messages more finely crafted and coherent than her latest admonition to seek out husbands with Ivy League degrees. But it's not the clunky prose or the endless redundancies that doomed the book from the beginning, and even a fine-tuned version would have only succeeded in putting a prettier face on her flawed advice. The real problem was trying to turn one page of clichéd sexist tropes and ugly elitism disguised as advice into 200+ pages (238, if we're counting) of constructive tips for young women today.

\indent I'm right in the target audience for Susan Patton's advice. I'm 25, an alumna of her cherished Princeton, and still not married. During my single years in New York City, I spent considerably more time working and considering my career options than dating or angling to meet new men. Patton clearly tries to preemptively extinguish criticism about the sexist roots of her advice by repeatedly assuring us that her advice is only for women who want to have children and ``something resembling a traditional marriage." Well, I want both -- surprise, I'll admit that despite having been brainwashed by feminists! -- so \ldots did I find Marry Smart to be just the no-nonsense straight talk that I needed to achieve my true dreams of Leave-It-To-Beaver-style domestic bliss?

\indent Well, if you define ``straight talk" as ``hideous sexist stereotypes that were outdated 20 years ago," then sure. But I can't say any of the advice actually seems useful or relevant to me, a 20-something in 2014. The only wise tidbits are so trite they hardly needed to be reiterated yet again -- e.g., get involved with activities you care about and date men with whom you share core values. And a lot of her more outr\'e advice seemed downright laughable.

\section[Paired Passages]{SAT Worksheet 4G: Paired Passages Practice Questions}
\textit{Directions: Read the following passages and answer the questions that follow.}

\bigskip
\textbf{The first passage is entitled ``Ain't I a Woman?" by Sojourner Truth, an African American activist. Passage 2 is taken from an address by Susan B. Anthony, a suffragist.}

\bigskip
\textbf{Passage 1}

\bigskip
\begin{linenumbers*}
\modulolinenumbers[5]
\indent That man over there says that women need to be helped into carriages, and lifted over ditches, and to have the best place everywhere. Nobody ever helps me into carriages, or over mud-puddles, or gives me any best place! And ain't I a woman? Look at me! Look at my arm! I have ploughed and planted, and gathered into barns, and no man could head me! And ain't I a woman? I could work as much and eat as much as a man - when I could get it - and bear the lash as well! And ain't I a woman? I have borne thirteen children, and seen most all sold off to slavery, and when I cried out with my mother's grief, none but Jesus heard me! And ain't I a woman?
\end{linenumbers*}

\bigskip
\textbf{Passage 2}

\bigskip
\begin{linenumbers}
\modulolinenumbers[5]
\indent The only question left to be settled, now, is: Are women persons? And I hardly believe any of our opponents will have the hardihood to say they are not. Being persons, then, women are citizens, and no state has a right to make any new law, or to enforce any old law, that shall abridge their privileges or immunities. Hence, every discrimination against women in the constitutions and laws of the several states, is to-day null and void, precisely as is every one against negroes.

\indent Is the right to vote one of the privileges or immunities of citizens? I think the disfranchised ex-rebels, and the ex-state prisoners will agree with me, that it is not only one of the them, but the one without which all the others are nothing. Seek the first kingdom of the ballot, and all things else shall be given thee, is the political injunction.
\end{linenumbers}

\bigskip
\begin{enumerate}

\item Share a satisfaction with the status quo
\item Are primarily concerned with legal reform

\item Are radicals that represent a threat to their societies
\end{enumerate}

\newpage
\item The relationship between the two passages can best be described as
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
\item Similar in ideological stance and complementary in style
\item Similar in ideological stance but different in style
\item Different in ideological stance but similar in style
\item Opposing in ideological stance and different in style
\item Contradictory in both ideological stance and style
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip
\item The author of passage 1 differs from the author of passage 2 in that she
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
\item Uses colloquial language and personal experience
\item Favors racial equality to gender equality
\item Expresses herself in an elevated and inaccessible manner
\item Alienates her audience with targeted criticism
\item Questions the authenticity of other female activists
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
\item Women
\item African Americans
\item Soldiers
\item Ex-rebels
\item Ex-state prisoners
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip
\item When the author of passage 1 says ``nobody...gives me any best place," she means
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
\item She has experienced but been unimpressed with the luxuries of the upper class.
\item She has not had the opportunity to experience ways of life in different cities and regions.
\item She has not been afforded the privileges enjoyed by women of higher socio-economic status.
\item She has rejected the help of men as unwelcome and condescending.
\item She feels she is less of a woman because she has not experienced the usual niceties extended to women.
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}

The passages below discuss the personality and achievements of Christopher Columbus.

\bigskip
\textbf{Passage 1}

\bigskip
\begin{linenumbers*}
\modulolinenumbers[5]
\indent Christopher Columbus was born in Genoa between August and October 1451. His father was a weaver and small-time merchant. As a teenager, Christopher went to sea, travelled extensively and eventually made Portugal his base. It was here that he initially attempted to gain royal patronage for a westward voyage to the Orient - his `enterprise of the Indies'.

\indent When this failed, and appeals to the French and English courts were also rejected, Columbus found himself in Spain, still struggling to win backing for his project. Finally, King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella agreed to sponsor the expedition, and on 3 August 1492, Columbus and his fleet of three ships, the Santa Maria, the Pinta and the Niña, set sail across the Atlantic.

\indent Ten weeks later, land was sighted. On 12 October, Columbus and a group of his men set foot on an island in what later became known as the Bahamas. Believing that they had reached the Indies, the newcomers dubbed the natives `Indians'. Initial encounters were friendly, but indigenous populations all over the New World were soon to be devastated by their contact with Europeans. Columbus landed on a number of other islands in the Caribbean, including Cuba and Hispaniola, and returned to Spain in triumph. He was made 'admiral of the Seven Seas' and viceroy of the Indies, and within a few months, set off on a second and larger voyage. More territory was covered, but the Asian lands that Columbus was aiming for remained elusive. Indeed, others began to dispute whether this was in fact the Orient or a completely `new' world.

\indent Columbus made two further voyages to the newfound territories, but suffered defeat and humiliation along the way. A great navigator, Columbus was less successful as an administrator and was accused of mismanagement. He died on 20 May 1506 a wealthy but disappointed man.

\textit{From BBC History}

\bigskip
\textbf{Passage 2}

\bigskip
\begin{linenumbers}
\modulolinenumbers[5]
\indent In 5,000 years of recorded history, scarcely another figure has ignited as much controversy. Each second Monday in October, the familiar arguments flare up. Christopher Columbus, rediscoverer of America, was a visionary explorer. He was a harbinger of genocide. He was a Christianizing messiah. He was a pitiless slave master. He was a lionhearted seaman, a rapacious plunderer, a masterly navigator, a Janus-faced schemer, a liberator of oppressed tribes, a delusional megalomaniac. In ``Columbus," Laurence Bergreen, the author of several biographies, allows scope for all these judgments. But Christopher Columbus was in the first place a terribly interesting man -- brilliant, audacious, volatile, paranoid, narcissistic, ruthless and (in the end) deeply unhappy.
\end{linenumbers}

\newpage
\begin{enumerate}
\item The tone of passage 1 could best be described as

\item Passage 1 introduces while Passage 2 elaborates
\item Passage 1 is nuanced while Passage 2 is more accessible
\item Passage 1 editorializes while Passage 2 promotes
\end {enumerate}

\bigskip
\item What best describes the attitude the author takes toward Christopher Columbus in passage 2?
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
\item Multitudinous and reproachful
\item Extolling and respectful
\item Discombobulated and disgruntled

\item Person who conquers other civilizations
\item Person who explores new lands
\item Person who navigates across the globe
\item Person who signals the approach of something
