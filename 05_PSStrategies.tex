\section[SAT Algebra]{General Strategies for SAT Algebra}

It can be difficult to know every concept on the SATs or more frequently, which topic(s) is best used to solve the problem. Therefore, if you get to a problem that you don't know how to solve, then you can use the following strategies to help you find the right answer. They spell the acronym PUFS (like the tissue company but with only 1 letter ``F'').

\bigskip
\textbf{\large P}lug in real numbers

\medskip
\textbf{\large U}se the answer choices

\medskip
\textbf{\large F}ormulas

\textbf{\large S}ee the problem

\textbf{SAT Math Strategy 1: Plug in real number}

\bigskip
Many SAT problems are made unnecessarily tricky by using \longline instead of \longline.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Assigning each variable a unique, \longline (for example, if there are variables $a, b$, and $c$ in the problem, make $a=2, b=3, c=5$). These numbers should be easy to work with. If you are using percentages, it is recommended to use \longline for the base variable because percentages are out of 100.
\item Solve the problem with these \longline instead of variables.
\item If necessary, translate the numbers back to \longline, percentages, fractions, etc
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Try It:} If $a$ is 1/3 of $b$ and $b$ is 2/5 of $z$ and $z>0$, then $a$ is what percentage of $z$?

\textbf{SAT Math Strategy 2: Use the answer choices}

If the question is multiple choice, then you may be able to plug in the answer choices into the question to see which answer choice gives you the correct answer.

\bigskip
Hint: It is suggested in SAT literature that if you try this approach, that you should start with answer choice C and work outwards or answer choice E and go backwards from E to A because the SATs will rarely make problems that can be solved with this strategy to have answer choice A.

**When you get to a problem that calls for a topic with a formula associated with it, write the general formula in words on your test booklet. For example, if there was a question that has to do with averages we would write down \longline. Then, rewrite the formula with the numbers or variables from the problems filled in.**
