\textbf{Content Practice:} The following is designed to ensure that you have a proper grasp of the concepts that you will see on the SAT math section. Read the words and definitions (if you don't already know them) and then answer the question that follows.

\bigskip
\begin{enumerate}[label=\bfseries\arabic*.]
\item \textbf{Whole Numbers, Integer, Decimal, Real Number} $-$ A whole number is any non-decimal, non-negative number (0 included). An integer is any non-decimal number, positive, negative, or 0. A decimal is a part of another number. A real number is a number that exists in the real plane instead of the imaginary.

\bigskip
\indent Identify the following numbers: $2, 0, -1, 0.25, i$

\vfill\item \textbf{Remainder} $-$ The amount left over after a long division. What is the remainder of the quotient of 20 and 2?

\vfill
\newpage
\item \textbf{Numerator/Denominator} $-$ The numerator is the number on top of a fraction. The denominator is the number on the bottom. If a fraction has a numerator of four and a denominator of five, what is its value as a decimal?

\vfill\item \textbf{Absolute Value} $-$ The distance away of a number from 0. It will always be represented as a positive number. Absolute value is represented by $|x|$.

\bigskip
\indent Evaluate the following: $|-3|+|6|\times|8|-|-15|$

\vfill\item \textbf{Sum, difference, product, quotient} $-$ The sum is the result of adding two numbers. The difference is the result of subtracting two numbers. The product is the result of multiplying two numbers. The quotient is the result of dividing two numbers.

\bigskip
\indent Find the sum, difference, product, and quotient of 15 and 5.

\vfill\item \textbf{Operation} $-$ A set of rules to explain what must the computation to be performed on two or more values

\bigskip
\indent Let the operation $x@y$ be equal to $3x+2y$. Evaluate $5@8$.

\vfill\item \textbf{Multiple, factor, prime, divisible by} $-$ A multiple is a number that can be divided by (is divisible by) another without a remainder. A factor is a number that can be used to divide another number without a remainder. A factor is anumber that can be used to divide another number without a remainder. A prime number is a number that cannot be divided by any number (except 1) without a remainder.

\bigskip
\indent List 5 multiples of 6.

\section[General Strategies]{General Strategies for the SAT Geometry Section}

\bigskip
\textbf{Strategy \#1: Visualization is key!} As we saw in the strategy section of the warm-up, \longline can help to break up complex language and also to give you a jumping off point to start solving the problem. If the SAT problems give you a diagram as part of the problem, then you should always start by marking the information given or that you can directly deduce directly onto the image.

\bigskip
\textbf{Strategy \#2: Minimize the number of variables!} Not having numbers at the onset of a problem can increase the difficulty level of the SAT problem, particularly the geometry problems. Therefore, if you can covert these relationships or variables to \underline{\hspace{1.5in}}, then it is easier to think about and solve the problem.

\bigskip
One way to do this: Whenever there is a relationship between two objects (angles, line segments, etc.), you are probably going to need to numerically solve for this relationship. This will either be your answer or it will directly be used to find your answer. Therefore, if you see a ratio in the problem, then convert it to variables and solve for the variables if possible. If you can convert a line segment to a number line with numerical distances, then do it!

\section{Distances on a Line}

\bigskip
Examples:

\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{enumerate}[label*=\arabic*.]
\item \textbf{Medium}

In the $xy$-coordinate plane, point $A$ is at $(1,5)$ and point $B$ is at $(-a,-3)$. The distance between points $A$ and $B$ is 12. What is the value of $a$?

\item \textbf{Medium}

Lines $l, m,$ and $r$ are all different lines that lie in the same plane. If $l\perp m, m\perp r$, and $r\perp s$, which of the following must be true?

\bigskip
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Roman*.]
\item $l\perp s$
\item $l\parallel r$
\item $m\perp s$
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
\item I only
\item I and II only
\item I and III only
\item II and III only
\item I, II, and III
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{multicols}

\vfill
Problem solving strategy for distances on a line:

\begin{spacing}{1.5}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Roman*)]
\item \longline if one doesn't exist
\item \longline the diagram (what is equal to what, etc). Convert it to a

\longline if possible
\item Solve for the \longline of the different segments
\item Use the information in steps \#$1-3$ to \longline

Other questions will ask you about the slope of a line or about parallel or perpendicular lines.

\bigskip
\textbf{To find the slope of a line:} You need at least 2 points on the line. Write down the $x$ and $y$ coordinates for points 1 and 2. Then, slope = $(y_2-y_1)/(x_2-x_1)$.

\bigskip
\textbf{About parallel lines:} Parallel lines have the same slope. To find the equation of a line parallel to the given line, find the slope of the given line (see \#1). It is also the ``$m$'' term in the equation of a line, $y=mx+b$. Then, plug in $x$ and $y$ coordinates to the equation of a line with the same $m$ as the original line and solve for $b$.

\bigskip
\textbf{About perpendicular lines:} The slopes of perpendicular lines are negative reciprocals. To find the equation of a line perpendicular to a given line, Find the slope of the given line (see \#1). It is also the ``$m$'' term in the equation of a line, $y=mx+b$. Then, take it's negative reciprocal to find the slope for the perpendicular line. Plug in $x$ and $y$ coordinates to the equation of a line with the m that was solved for in the previous step. Solve for $b$.

There are two main types of questions with triangles on the SATs that involve triangles: solving for angles in a triangle and solving for a side length of a triangle. Many of these will involve special right triangles.

Solving for side lengths: You will primarily use the Pythagorean theorem and Pythagorean triples, rules of special right triangles, and rules of the lengths of a triangle.

\item What is the general rule for the lengths of the side lengths of a triangle?
