\section{Patters and Sequences}

A remainder is the amount left over after \longline. For example, six will divide into 19 three times with a remainder of \longline.
We can usually use one of two strategies to solve these types of problems.

\vfill
\textbf{Strategy \#1:} If a remainder problem contains a variable problem, then we can

\longline that fits the parameters and then use this number to solve for what the problem is asking. 

\bigskip
For example: When 2m is a divided by 4, the remainder is 5. What will the remainder be when $3m$ is divided by 10?

\vfill
\textbf{Strategy \#2:} Then you need to come up with \longline and solve for the \longline in order to solve. 
For example, When 48 is divided by a positive integer $n$, the remainder is 4. How many values of $n$ are possible?

\vfill
We are also going to use a strategy similar to Strategy \#2 in order to solve problems that repeat numbers, symbols, etc. by using divisibility rules. We are particularly interested in the  \longline.

\bigskip
For example, A fashionista is laying out her colored scarves. She first lays down 2 red scarves, then 3 blue scarves, then 1 green scarf, then 2 orange scarves, then 1 pink scarf. She repeats this pattern until she has laid out all 1,000 scarves. What color is the 782\textsuperscript{nd} scarf?

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
\item red
\item blue
\item green
\item orange
\item pink
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Start by writing \longline iterations of the pattern on top of each other:
\vfill\item \longline the end of each line
\vfill\item You will see that you are counting up by \longline occurring in the first line
\vfill\item Divide the \longline by the \longline.

Find the \longline.
\vfill\item Start at the beginning of the pattern. Count each unique item in the pattern until you reach the same number as the \longline. This item in the pattern is the \longline.
\end{enumerate}

Example \#2: There are 5 ducks in a row behind the mother ducks, Ariel, Boston, Carl, Devin, and Edward. Every day, the ducks take a turn swimming behind the mother so it is Ariel's turn, then Boston's turn, then Carl's turn, then Devin's turn, then Edward's turn. If Boston swims behind his mother on the first day, who will be swimming behind the mother on the 42\textsuperscript{nd} day?

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
\item Ariel
\item Boston
\item Carl
\item Devin
\item Edward
\end{enumerate}

\vfill
Example \#3: Every day, Steven runs one errand or completes one chore. On the first day, he goes to the grocery store. On the next day, he goes to the laundry mat, and on the next day, he goes to the pharmacy. On the next day, Steven goes to the car mechanic, and on the next day, he cleans the house. After this, he repeats his chore list (so the day after cleaning the house, he goes to the grocery store). One day that he went to the car mechanic, he went to the movies immediately afterwards. Which of the following could be the number of days he did chores prior to the day that he decided to go to the movies? \textbf{[Note: In previous problems, it has given you the total number and wants you to find the unique item. This problem gives you the unique item, that he goes to the movies, and wants you to use divisibility rules to find the total number. You can use steps \#1-5 above, but you need to reverse them.]}

\bigskip
Each term in the sequence after the first term is 5 more than the term before it. The 45\textsuperscript{th} term than the 37\textsuperscript{th} term? \textbf{The challenge is to solve this without solving for the 37\textsuperscript{th} and the 45\textsuperscript{th} term.}

\item 38
\item 40
\end{enumerate}

\vfill
We will use the idea of writing out the possible items to solve problems that ask about the minimum number of items selected in order to guarantee some situation. 

\bigskip
For example, there are 144 marbles in a box. There are 24 marbles of each of the following colors: red, blue, green, white, black, and gray. Tom randomly selects marbles from the box.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
\item What is the minimum number of marbles Tom needs to select in order to guarantee that he gets at least two marbles of the same color? 

\bigskip
To solve this, we need to think of the \longline. In this scenario, he selects \longline before he selects a second marble of any color.

\section{Probability}

In general, probability of an event is occurring is defined as:

\vfill
The most difficult type of probability questions are when multiple events are occurring because you must take into account the wording of the question to give you a clue as to whether the events are happening together or separately and also if the items are getting replaced or not (as this will affect the denominator when you are solving the problem). 
Probability is a number between \shortline and \shortline. \shortline represents the sum of all of the events that could happen. For example, on a fair two-sided coin, the options from one coin flip are getting a tails or a head (and nothing else). The probability of getting the tail side is Â½ and the probability of getting the head side is $1/2$ and$1/2 + 1/2 =1$.

\vfill
If you want to know the probability of an event not happening, you will need to find the probability of it happening and subtract this probability from \shortline. This is called the \longline.

\vfill
\longline events are when the results of the first event affects the probability of the second event occurring or not occurring.

\vfill
\longline events are when the results of the first event affects the probability of the second event occurring or not occurring.

\vfill
If you want to know the probability of two independent events happening, then

\longline the probabilities. For example, you would use this method when you select a ball from a jar, put it back in the jar, and then choose another ball (called choosing with replacement).

\vfill
If you want to know the probability of two dependent events happening, then you will need to \longline the probability of the second event based on the first event happening. For example, you would use this method when you select a ball from a jar, and then choose another ball without putting the first ball back (called choosing without replacement).  If the probability of choosing a green ball is 7/10 and you want to know the probability of choosing two green balls in a row without replacement, then you calculate the probability of the first ball being green, 7/10, and the second ball being green with the first green ball removed, which is $(7 - 1)/(10 - 1) = 6/9$. Therefore, the probability of getting two green balls in a row without replacement of the first ball would be $7/10 \cdot 6/9 = 42/90$.

\vfill
If you want to know the probability of neither happening, you will need to find the probability of either happening and subtract this probability from \shortline. This is called the \longline.

\vfill
\newpage
We will now use one example and see how many ways a problem can be asked. In each case, there are 10 red balls and 12 blue balls in Jar $A$ and 3 red balls and 9 blue balls in Jar $B$. Show your work when solving for each problem so that you can see the differences between the words and problem-solving steps for it. 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
\item A person picks one ball from Jar A, records the color, puts it back in the jar and then picks a ball from Jar B. What is the probability that the first ball is red or the second ball is blue?
\vfill\item A person picks one ball from Jar A, records the color, and picks a ball from Jar B. What is the probability that the first ball is red and the second ball is blue?
\vfill\item What is the difference in wording between a) and b)? How does this account for different approaches that you need to use to solve the two problems?
\vfill\item A person picks one ball from Jar A, records the color, and picks another ball from Jar A without putting the first ball back in the jar. What is the probability that both balls selected are red?
\vfill\item A person picks one ball from Jar A, records the color, and picks another ball from Jar A without putting the first ball back in the jar What is the probability that both balls selected are the same color?
\vfill\item What is the difference in wording between d) and e)? How does this account for different approaches that you need to use to solve the two problems?
\vfill\item g)	A person picks one ball from Jar A, records the color, replaces the first ball and picks another ball from Jar A. What is the probability that both balls selected are red?
